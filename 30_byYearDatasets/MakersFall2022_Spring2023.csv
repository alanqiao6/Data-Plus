And the need of substantial energy has escalated too, In order to take the inventions to the next level. Most of the energy sources, like natural gas and fossil fuels, are nonrenewable, which means someday we could run out of them. Today, we are already seeing some indications. Which is why humans need to find durable energy sources before it truly happens. After knowing the current and potential problems, I genuinely want to work with Ignite to learn more about energy, and find better use of present-day energy sources, or even discover a long-term energy source.","I ever participated the Ignite Learner program this Spring.

It pains me to know that millions of people in different parts of the world struggle to even get access to one glass of clean water. Even in the United States in rural areas like Flint Michigan, accessing clean water is one of the biggest challenges of survival. Meanwhile, in the more suburban areas like Cary and Charlotte, we have plenty of water to drink, to shower, to clean our dishes and clothes, and even enough to do some recreation. It's not fair that we can take water for granted while millions of people around the world are dying of thirst. It‚Äôs hard to believe that over 70% of Earth‚Äôs water is harbored in the oceans and it cannot easily be consumed in this form. I believe that there can be a way to end this crisis of thirst on our planet by making use of our oceans. If these vast bodies of water can be utilized, not only will thirst be minimal, but also water-borne illnesses will be prevented, sanitation standards will be raised, and an increase in agriculture and food production. Of course, there are the small first steps that everyone can take like taking short showers and not letting the tap run for too long. However, when you look at the bigger picture, the most practical way of solving this problem is to find an effective way to make use of ocean water especially for our growing population and increasing need for resources. 
","After graduating High School, I plan on going to med school. I‚Äôve always wanted to help out my community in different ways and for me, I think I can give my best service to the world as a doctor. I would love to be a part of the Ignite program as a maker because I‚Äôve been looking at research opportunities for a while, and getting to work with Duke undergrad students will be a great first stepping stone for my future. I am especially interested in delving deeper into the UN‚Äôs sustainable development goal of clean water. After doing some research, I found out that sea water reverse osmosis is currently one of the most widely utilized technologies for water desalination. However, reverse osmosis is not very efficient. One major problem of this technology is that it wastes significantly more water than it produces. Another disadvantage of reverse osmosis is that not only does it remove the bad contaminants in the water, but it also removes the healthy minerals such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium. I would love to work with Duke‚Äôs undergrad students to add on to this research and find a way to make it more efficient.

Oftentimes, my visits with my grandparents and extended family in India ended not only with immense joy but a feeling of sadness. While I was grateful for any chance to see them, I was often saddened knowing that they lived in an area with limited resources, making it extremely hard to access medical help. Additionally, their financial ability also made it even harder to find affordable and accessible options much like the hundreds of people that lived in their village and across the country. Over the summer, I was given the opportunity to participate in a biomedical engineering program where I was able to compile my learning to work on a project with a partner to research, design, and utilize CAD to model a portable device aimed to detect known human carcinogens from second-hand smoke within the human body. We modeled the device with impoverished countries in mind, where the issue of secondhand smoke inhalation tends to be highly prevalent but rarely addressed. We made sure to design our product to be a reusable and portable machine, to allow better access within impoverished areas lacking proper medical care and hospitals. While working on this project, I often replayed memories of my aunts cooking in India over an open fire when their stove wasn‚Äôt working properly. The smoke and smell from this was something I can still recall to this day and the research I had conducted prior to the designing of my device only furthered my desire to find a solution for this problem. Our research showed that second-hand smoke contained over 7,000 chemicals, 250 of which are known human carcinogens that could cause cancer within the human body. Seeing firsthand what it was like for people in these areas, and how unbeknownst to them the damage that was being inflicted upon their bodies as a result of their simple everyday practices. The creation of this device helped to further my passion for biomedical engineering and finding medical solutions for those that are unable to access them. Furthermore, my experience working as a director within a nonprofit aimed at donating food and money for hundreds of food-insecure families also continued to open my eyes to the hardships that those in unprivileged areas experience. I truly believe that the UN Sustainable Development Goal for good health and nutrition is one of the most important for those privileged enough to access resources as well as those that are unable to as it can be a differentiator between life and death. I sincerely hope that medical innovations will expand to ensure that no one will ever make their health a second choice and that I will be able to partake in making such a thing possible.","For me, I've found that there is no greater satisfaction than diving into the depths of a problem and getting my hands dirty to find the solution. Through my experiences within middle and high school, I've found that this passion could be combined with my love for engineering and biology to tackle the issues plaguing not only my community but those in need globally. Over the summer, I was selected to participate in a biomedical engineering program where I was able to see various presentations from professors and Ph.D. students from Stanford University, Georgia Tech, Texas A&M, and even Dr. Megan Madonna from Duke University. Later, utilizing my learnings from these presentations, I was able to work on a project with a partner to research, design, and CAD model a portable device aimed to detect known human carcinogens from second-hand smoke within the human body. We modeled the device with impoverished countries in mind, where the issue of secondhand smoke inhalation tends to be highly prevalent but rarely addressed. This not only opened my eyes to the opportunities within biomedical engineering to create change but also allowed me to apply knowledge to solve an issue for those in need. In the long-term, I hope to utilize my passions to pursue biomedical engineering and focus on the intersections of engineering to address issues within the medical field for those that are underprivileged, sepcifically within the field of cancer. In college, and even through the rest of my high school career, I hope to continue gaining experience within the biomedical engineering field and healthcare broadly through hands-on research experience to utilize in my career later. I hope to pursue an M.D./Ph.D to gain more insight within the health field to focus on biodesign as a physician or researcher in the future. As a director of Bread for America, a student-led nonprofit aimed at erradicating hunger, I've been given the chance to create change and help those in need by raising $30K+ and donating over 10,000 pounds of food to food-insecure families. This helped me realize my passion for making change, through science and activism alike, and continues to be a vital part of who I am, another reason why I aim to continue my research to specifically address and be accessible to the issues of those in need. Through the Center for Global Health Technologies and as an Ignite Maker, I believe that I can utilize the opportunity to continue my learning within the engineering field with the combined support of my peers and mentors to design prototypes to address a health issue within my community, and even potentially continue working on my model of the device to detect scond hand smoke inhalation. I plan to utilize what I learn to continue fostering my love for biomedical engineering while using it towards furthering my knowledge to continue my work as a student, future engineer, and lifelong learner.","It would be simple‚Ä¶right? ‚ÄúDesign bioengineering-based solutions to a real-world medical problem‚Äù ‚Äì little did I know, that these were the 8 words that would plague my thoughts for the following weeks. After being assigned to complete a project by utilizing my knowledge on biomedical engineering and the bioedesign process, my initial reaction of excitement soon turned into curiosity, later becoming worry. In the coming few weeks, I would find out that this project would not only influence my interests but even my career goals. Our first step, was to identify our problem, or what we would be working to solve. After intensely researching, my partner and I were able to find a big issue; many people, often times from impoverished and underprivileged areas, had no idea that they were even inhaling second-hand smoke. Our research showed that second-hand smoke contained over 7,000 chemicals, 250 of which are known human carcinogens that could cause cancer within the human body. We found that this second-hand smoke was often considered worse than inhaling primary smoke from cigarettes. After coming up with our needs statement, we quickly hit a wall. In fact, we had no idea on where to go next. After even more research, planning, and designing, we began to make some more progress but were still unsuccessful in coming up with with our device. After coming together to pool our work and knowledge, we were finally able to come together to begin and create our preliminary designs for the components of our device. Although it took hours of research, hard work, frustration, and often mini-debates within our team, we were able to successfully design, and later utilize CAD (Computer-aided design) to model our final device. Despite the hard work, time, and strenuinity that this project required, I had realized that I had enjoyed every bit of it. The excitement of learning more about cancer and second-hand smoke, as well as the issues faced by those living in impoverished areas, such as my grandparents,  only continued to fuel my passion for this topic but for biomedical engineering as a whole. As a result of this project, my patience and determination was tested but I was able to take away the knowledge I gained in addition to realizing the importance of team work, hard work, and continued perseverance despite any obstacles that may be faced. I know that these will be some of the many skills that I will continue to utilize on a day-to-day basis as I further my future within biomedical engineering.",Y,8/27/22,Anwitha Kumbham,Non-binary / third gender,pre,Evaluating because it allows communities to share feedback and needs that the prototype has  to take into account in the future,All of the above are viable solutions to the new need,Listen to the community,Evaluate,"Focus on community goals because goals, like problems, require attention and effort","Feasibility- will it be an affordable option for people?,Desirability- does the design solve a problem?,Viable- is it a short or long-term solution for the problem?",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,50,80,90,70,,50,60,80,70,"While I am confident in my abilities to put in the work and time required to create a product utilizing the engineering design process by utilizing my prior knowledge of the engineering design and biodesign processes, I feel I may require some guidance in relation to the actual constructing of a product and the use of various materials.",100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,"My motivations throughout the engineering design process is knowing that I could create something that would potentially impact and benefit the lives of people in need.

The opportunity to build a basic version of our device was extremely beneficial and helped eased this with the support of the trainers/Ignite team as it made the process much more understandable. I have some anxiety about testing (as it is something that would be not have been possible with the problem we picked), so I remain apprehensive with my understanding of how testing could work ‚Äî although conversations with the team on potential ways to test have allowed more insight into this.  I was also initially somewhat unsure of how building a 3D prototype would work being completely virtual. While I had to figure some parts out by researching myself, I found that the process was simplified and I was still able to do the same things as students in-person through the support of the program. Working with circuits was somewhat of a challenge, as I was still pretty new to that but I was able to openly receive feedback and advice that made it much easier to learn and figure out issues.","The entire experience of being a Maker was, in and of itself, extremely rewarding ‚Äî I have learnt a lot about the engineering design process and have become much more confident in my abilities. I think I learnt the most during the building/execution step as it was something that I was most unfamiliar with going into the process and was looking forward to exploring the most. I think having the support of the team/trainers was the most rewarding part of being a Maker as I was able to learn and ask questions to receive advice that I wouldn‚Äôt have elsewhere. Beyond that, having the organization with the program made it much easier and helped keep me on track so there was structured way to approach the engineering design process. Overall, I‚Äôve learnt so much from this entire program and have only furthered my interest in biomedical engineering.","The most difficult part of the program was coordinating between my partner and I (both being from different cities), as well as building virtually. While the support and help of the trainers/team made the process much easier, I did find it hard learning about circuitry and figuring out the process. I think coming into the program with an idea and some preliminary research made it much easier so we could have a more clear idea on potential final results. This also provided its own challenges as we didn‚Äôt need as much time to research potential issues, etc. but we were able to spend that time looking further into existing solutions and designing possibilities for our final creation.","The UN Sustainable Goal 3 is still one of the most important goals to me because it is one that resonates the deepest with me. My original interest in it was sparked due to the conditions and lack of resources my grandparents, living in rural India had, but through the Ignite program, I have been able to explore the depth of the issue which has further solidified my belief that it is a goal I want to work towards achieving through engineering. I hope to further my focus on accessibility and sustainability so that people living in communities lacking resources, oftentimes who need them most or are extremely affected by issues, can access the help they need.","I think the Ignite Maker program helped to further solidify my passion for biomedical engineering and opened my eyes to the possibilities within the field. As of right now, I am between studying biomedical or mechanical engineering but the program has helped me direct my focus to want to work on creating innovations focused on accessibility and aiding those living in low-access areas.","If I could change any part of the Ignite program, I would hope to allot more time towards the building/execution phase of the program. I think being virtual led to a greater learning curve, especially when dealing with circuitry, which required further time and research on how to figure things out. Overall, I felt that the year and program was extremely successful ‚Äî with my participation being one of the highlights of the school year ‚Äî and I truly believe I learnt a lot and have become a better student and future engineer because of it.",
196,Arya Kumar,Arya,Kumar,She/her/hers,17,Senior/12th,Asian,Durham Academy,Durham,27514,GWHT website,Global health,4,Good Health,"‚ÄúAt the beginning of the pandemic, I began reading extensively, and after reading Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity by Katherine Boo and learning about the daily struggles in Annawadi, one of the 2,400 slums in Mumbai, I began to realize that a fundamental part of sustainable development is access to clean water, proper sanitation, and effective health care. However, this does not only mean building infrastructure with good sanitation, clean water, and health care; it is critical to target the existing health problems within these areas before sustainable development occurs. Infrastructure conducive to a healthy population is only adequate if it mainly works to prevent diseases rather than treat existing diseases; hence, it must target a healthy population. Focusing on populations‚Äô health is a substantial prerequisite to sustainable development.‚Äù
The above is what I wrote in my Ignite Maker application last January before I began to research diseases in these slums. Although I initially intended to focus on communicable diseases in slums, I quickly realized that there are already so many efforts to counter communicable diseases. I realized that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) lack adequate attention, so I decided to focus on researching diabetes and its prevalence in Mumbai slums. This led me to design a prototype that would assist people in taking their medicines because a significant problem in these areas with diabetes was a lack of adherence to medicines. 
From when I began reading about health in Mumbai slums to my time researching diabetes, my understanding of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of health has broadened, showing me the larger picture of maladies that plague the impoverished in Indian slums. However, I am still far from completely understanding what this sustainable development goal encompasses. However, I expanded my understanding a little bit this past summer. I spent six weeks in Delhi, India, where I got a glimpse into the poverty that some people in this city face. On the surface, it‚Äôs hard to determine whether a person is suffering from a disease. However, one thing that struck me was the malnourished look of the people I saw on the streets. I had an hour bus ride every morning to school, during which I would see people lying on the streets and waking up. It was extremely disheartening, and having this first-hand experience of seeing the struggles that these people go through has shown me the next steps I want to take in researching and coming up with solutions.","I have always loved learning about the world, and because of this, I have always imagined my future being in a different country. Combined with my interest in global health, I know that I want to work abroad in impoverished communities to fix healthcare in these communities. In addition, I really enjoy studying culture and languages. I have studied Spanish in school since 5th grade, and I have recently been learning Hindi and Tamil. Through my language studies, I have learned more about languages and culture. I love discovering different aspects of the culture of places around the world, specifically in Latin American countries and India. My current Spanish teacher is Peruvian, and I have immensely enjoyed learning about Peruvian culture from her. In addition, my family is from India, and I have grown up learning about the culture in Tamil Nadu (where my parents are from). However, there is only so much one can learn about culture; immersion is necessary to experience culture truly. This is another reason why I want to live abroad: I want to immerse myself in cultures that are different from the culture I have grown up in. Through working abroad, I hope to combine my passion for global health with my language and cultural studies. I have been exploring ways to study both global health and culture to begin this process. 
Specifically, I would like to pursue a double major in college in Global Health and Cultural Anthropology. I think that this combination of majors would be perfect in that it would allow me to pursue my passion for working in global health with my desire to learn more about people, culture, and languages. In addition, during college, I would like to spend at least one semester studying abroad, gaining experience in healthcare in another country. Specifically, I want to help make healthcare more accessible to people living in impoverished and rural areas. I also want to teach people how to create the tools to stay healthy for themselves. Both of these experiences will only come with studying abroad, so studying abroad in college is something I want to do. Ideally, I would like to spend time in India because ever since learning about the health issues that plague the slums of India‚Äôs most populous cities (such as Mumbai and Bangalore), I have had a strong interest in working to improve healthcare in these slums as well as improving health education in these slums. I would also like to participate in different global health projects in my undergraduate years, such as Ignite. In addition, after college, I have been thinking about participating in Peace Corps. Spending two years in a different country and working to improve healthcare in a community is a perfect opportunity for me to grow in global health and immerse myself in a different culture. In terms of my career, I know that I want to live abroad working in global health; however, I am not sure of what career paths offer this. My thoughts are to focus on educating myself and gaining experience in this field so that I am as well equipped as possible when the time comes to search for career options. 
Because I want to learn as much as possible about global health and expose myself to this field, I am interested in working with GWHT as an Ignite Maker. I want to help design solutions for health issues in different locations, and this seems to me like the perfect place to gain exposure, experience, and knowledge about this. ","Going to the movies with friends in a foreign country where neither you nor your friends can speak the language proficiently is not necessarily the greatest idea. I had been in Delhi for two weeks when my friends and I went to see a movie in a theater as a part of a school activity. Naturally, we wanted to buy snacks. In Delhi, one purchases food in a movie theater differently than in the United States; instead of simply buying food from the concession stands outside the theater, there is someone in the theater who will take your order. We were told that there were three flavors of ice cream: chocolate, vanilla, and almond. My friends and I ordered three chocolate ice creams for the cost of 450 ‚Çπ ($5.67). However, when the waitress returned, she held three almond ice creams. Before we even knew that she had given us the wrong flavor, she had disappeared. Holding the almond ice creams in our hands and knowing that we had already paid for them, we were unsure what to do. At that point, all we wanted was a refund. We all walked outside to the concessions stand and requested a refund in English. No one there spoke English. However, we wanted that refund. All three of us began trying to speak in broken Hindi to ask them for a refund. Over and over, they said that it was against their policy, and please, do try the almond ice cream! Eventually, I began to talk with more confidence and was able to begin guilt-tripping the cashiers in Hindi. I told them that they lied to us and told us there was chocolate ice cream for sale when they only had vanilla and almond ice creams. Because of this, I told them we needed a refund. They then told us it was against policy, after which I angrily asked them where this was written. At this point, my perseverance had caused a decently large commotion, and the manager came over. I calmly explained to him the situation, and he, probably fed up with my antics, gave us the refund.

I think this is in large part because I decided to continue my project from last year. A few weeks in, I really wanted to just start from scratch, but I felt as though it was too late. From then on, I felt kind of clueless about what I was trying to do and ended up doing a lot of research about random tangentially related things and not really doing many productive things at least where my project was concerned.","The UN Sustainable development goal of health is still very important to me. I really want to be able to help move closer to attaining this goal, and I think that through Ignite, I began to understand more what methods of helping are actually beneficial.","They have slightly changed, but the fact that I want to go into global health has not. At first, I wanted to go down more of a humanities track, trying to integrate culture and health; however, now I feel as though I might want to take a more science-oriented direction.","I know it is meant to be unstructured, but sometimes I just have no clue what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing. This might also be my fault, but I think that a little more structure couldn‚Äôt hurt (something like having everyone share a Google folder with the trainers such that people are held accountable or something like that).",

I think it is necessary to acknowledge that we are going through tough times in terms of communicable diseases. I think it is very important to raise awareness on preventative methods. Another thing is that I have been passionate about health for a while now and it is a potential career goal of mine to work in a health department. I want to help people and make sure that everyone is the best that they can be. This is also important to me because I want to be able to come up with something that‚Äôll help a group of people feel welcomed and included. I feel that there are a lot of individuals going through health problems that feel alone. I want to help them feel like they are able to talk to others and to show them they are not alone. ,"I‚Äôve always wanted to pursue something in the STEM field. I just needed clarification on what I wanted to do. After helping with cancer patients last year, I realized what I really wanted to help out in: hospital management. I want to major in Public Health and Business in the near future and hopefully get into that field. I want to do this because I realized how much it would help other people to be one of the people managing the place. I am interested in continuing my work as an Ignite Maker because it not only gives me exposure to a research side of the field, but also allows me to use my creative thinking to come up with plans to help.

When I was little I lived with my grandma in California. It was 2009 and I didn‚Äôt understand why we had to use fake grass in the backyard. We had it because California was facing a water shortage and still is affected by global warming even in 2009. It‚Äôs important to me because without clean energy we will see more people abandoning their homes because of the rise of sea levels. In AP human geography our last project was we looked at every UN Sustainable Development Goal. In the project we came up with proposals that countries should take to help them reach the SDGs. The SDGs that I enjoyed exploring the most was #10 because globally we are facing huge income disparities. Out of the ones offered here clean energy speaks the most to me because it's relevant through the Inflation Reduction Act. The U.S is back agreeing with the rest of the world that we will have to stop producing carbon emissions and reducing our footprint through incentives. In Duke REP we had a module that used electrical engineering that is the most similar to clean energy because you're basically making technology that will help power the world in a sustainable way.,My college goals are to get into college as an engineering major. I would love to go to college because I would be the first in my family to attend a 4-year university. I believe I have worked hard in some of the hardest classes my school offers and challenged myself through taking them. I really haven't thought much about a career goal. I just imagined I would find some type of job in engineering because the triangle area has many STEM opportunities. I know college is not as helpful as it used to be 50 years ago but you will make connections there to find employment once you graduate. Apple and Google are moving into the area. I would hope to find a job at one of those companies. Over this summer I explored biomedical engineering research at the tosh lab. It let me experience a lot of research because biomed engineering is a combination of many types of fields. It was an amazing experience and I got to run my own assay with the help of my mentor. I want to explore more research opportunities related to global issues like climate change. Clean energy is vital to stop climate change. One of my instructors at Duke REP talked about this opportunity and it sounded exciting. That's why I'm interested in working at Global Health Technologies as an Ignite Maker.,"It was the beginning of the new year. Within my robotics team we call it build season. During build season the engineers work on building the robot but my team has 2 divisions the other one is engagement. We do outreach events and contact sponsors. During build season we write an essay we submit to FIRST and it's called chairman‚Äôs award. It is just as equally as important as building the robot. We put what the team has done over the past 3 years since last time we submitted. The issue was I would write my paragraphs as an analytical paper instead of showcasing stories and the meaning behind them. My leader never told me anything was wrong with it but as the due date came closer stress started to arise. Most of it not even being done yet, I decided not to go to the meetings because I lost my ride to get there. I stopped going to meetings for almost 2 weeks. I was on the verge of being dismissed from the team. When I went back my division leader and the coach of the team pulled me aside and talked about my future on the team. They asked what I thought was the fair decision because I meet the criteria to be dismissed. I told them they should dismiss me from the team. The coach told me because I was there it showed I still had interest in being a part of the team. I told him yes I still wanted to be part of the team but it was unfair to my group that I made them write the parts I was supposed to do. We came to an agreement that I shouldn't miss any more hours. I would have to ask someone for a ride to the team space that went to my school. I was the problem but I went back to see my fate on the team. I restarted my attempt to write the paper. I hit writer's block and so did my group. We all relaxed for a moment. Next we thought about how we could get out of the block and my friend mentioned we could see previous submissions. We finally got a flow and finished just as it was about to be due.

205,Khadija Diop,Khadija,Diop,She/her/hers,17,Senior/12th,Black or African American,The School for Creative Studies,Durham,27712,Email,Health Administration and Biomedical Engineering,4,Good Health,"  My interest in health is personal. My father is senegalese, and to truly grasp my full identity, I've lived some of my years in Senegal and Gambia. As a result, my experiences there have shed light on and shaped my views about global health. I‚Äôve realized that there is a great imbalance in access to healthcare in the global community, and within countries as well. Having lived in both the U.S. and Senegal, I've witnessed them. I'm able to receive medicare in the United States. I've had many visits to clinics, hospitals, and dental facilities throughout my life and I've never once had to stop and carefully consider whether my family could afford it. The same applies to my siblings and my parents. When I visit Gambia, however, I notice that things aren't the same for my family members there. Every trip to the limited hospitals in the area requires a fee, and no one in my family has insurance to cover it. The services that I witnessed there also greatly contrasted with what I was used to. A small room, crowded together with the hospital beds of dozens of other patients is where one of my cousins gave birth. When I had visited her, I noticed that utilities and supplies seemed to be the bare minimum. Her baby didn‚Äôt survive. And it‚Äôs not just her. I have many other cousins who had miscarriages. It‚Äôs very common to have infant deaths during delivery in my family. Those who could afford it often traveled overseas to be treated for their conditions in more developed facilities. This is a problem that exists everywhere. Even in the United States, where I‚Äôm able to receive the proper healthcare that I need, there are people who don‚Äôt qualify. My family and community in the Gambia don‚Äôt receive the services that I‚Äôve experienced, and it hurts when I think about it, because I feel like I‚Äôm being favored, somehow. I‚Äôve also realized that the access to and quality of health facilities aren‚Äôt the only factors that affect the health of my community. My interest in health spurted from wanting to change the inequality that my family goes through, and from there, I wish to make a meaningful impact, not only on my family, but on any others who experience it. 
","  I have a vision of my ambitions and a general idea of a plan for my future career, but those plans aren‚Äôt set in stone. I intend to pursue a degree in Health Administration or Public Health, and Biomedical Engineering. I then hope to continue my education through medical school and become a medical doctor. This arrangement, however, is subject to slight modification. Being interested in health, engineering, and medicine, I‚Äôm still in the process of carving my career path to give me the best of all three fields. I‚Äôm also considering whether I wish to pursue medical research in graduate school before aiming for medicine. My main drive to follow such a path is to broaden my knowledge on how to fund adequate healthcare for individuals, expand medical technology, and promote healthy communities. My greatest ambition is to open various healthcare facilities and find the means to fund healthcare to support my local community in the Gambia and expand from there. As a high school student, school consumes most of my time and there aren‚Äôt many opportunities in my classroom for me to explore and receive hands-on experience in what I want to do. I feel that working with IGNITE will allow me exactly that. I believe that it will give me the incentive to critically think about how I can directly apply my strengths to solve problems and achieve my future goals. 
","  The first time I was told to ‚Äúengineer‚Äù a solution to a problem, I was stuck, like my feet were submerged in hardening cement. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I solved a problem, but the memory burns bright because it was my first assignment as an engineer. It was a PLTW course and I was assigned a team to figure out how to save a group of people (colored chips) from drowning when a natural disaster occurred. It had seemed impossible. We had one hour, and I remember there being about 5 paper clips, a 3 inch strand of tape, a pair of scissors, a balloon, a rubber band, an empty paper towel roll, and about 4 index cards, I think (why the list is so specific, I don‚Äôt know, I probably added extra things). With this random arrangement of items, we were told to construct a system that would transport the colored chips over a certain distance without touching it. My entire group was shocked, and it seemed that we would all fail the assignment. The time limit started, and we rushed to the supplies. We gathered and discussed our ideas, no matter how impossible they seemed, because from the way our teacher was grinning behind his desk, it was obvious that it could be done. We all kind of clicked, because none of us wanted a bad grade. The ideas were crazy, but with the small inventory, we discovered that there were a variety of different solutions we could create. We had no idea whether our ideas were even plausible, but time was running out, so we had no choice but to continue forward. A good amount of the ideas failed. Multiple times, in fact. But I don‚Äôt remember any of us getting upset. Just jumpy, rattled and full of unrest, blurting out any alternative we could think of. We would only have two attempts to deliver all the chips, so I suggested we fold the index cards into packages, sealed with paper clips to hold all the chips in one place. Another member of our team thought to place the packages in the paper towel roll, blow up the balloon and slip it in the hole so that when it deflated, it would push the roll and the chips over the line. None of us really stopped to figure out if that was how physics worked, but it sounded like a great idea, which it was, even though it didn‚Äôt work. Before her idea, we had never considered using the roll. But then another idea sparked in one of our other team members. She thought we could use the roll to make a slingshot with the rubber band. Sure enough, when she slipped the band over the roll and pulled it back, holding the package of chips, it shot forward. It was so simple that we had to take a moment to think about how long it took for us to try it. It was some time ago and the all the details are a bit blurry, but that memory was a very exciting moment for me because it was the first time I had experienced what being an engineer was like and the power of team input in such a situation.

206,Lishore Kumar,Lishore,Kumar,he/him/his,16,Junior/11th,Asian,Tomball Memorial High School,Tomball,77377,YiBE,Biomedical Engineering,4,Good Health,"	As a Speech and Debate student, I‚Äôve learned the importance of not just domestic issues, but international ones. Through wars and political turmoil, one of the only shared factors between countries is the want for scientific development and global wellbeing. Perfectly conveying this, is the Global Health and Wellbeing initiative of the UN, not just highlighting the wanting nature of our global health, but also recognizing that there are wide disparities in key demographics of people. Being one of the first goals to focus on equity rather than solely equality, the Global Health Initiative allows us to keenly focus on countries and communities that continue to be harmed. 
        Living in 3 different countries, 2 of which are developing, I‚Äôve seen the shared prevalence of sicknesses and diseases cascade through them; not only harming people, but wiping out decades of scientific progress. As such, the Global Health and Wellbeing goal is critical to addressing diseases like Covid-19 and Malaria, as well as targetting long-standing issues like pollution and educating others on sexual reproduction. Through events like the Covid-19 pandemic, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs simply not possible to address health issues on a domestic level, but rather on a culminated international scale. Working with an initiative that represents a coming-together of communities will allow me to not only make scientific progress, but social progress as well.","	Through my engineering classes in high school as well as my international political background, I‚Äôve fostered an interest in the combination of the two. As such, I‚Äôd like to major in Biomedical Engineering and minor in Political science. I believe that by coupling biomedical engineering with Political science, I can understand health markets on a governmental and political scale; an overlooked reality of the health industry. Finally, I‚Äôd like to master in Biomechanics due to my want of making medical device innovations. 
	For Duke IGNITE, I have three potential research prospects in the Global Health and Wellbeing initiative. First, I can research vaccine disparities in specific demographics and create a program to help bridge that gap. A second research interest that I have is looking at obesity rates in rural areas of the world and creating a potential solution to the problem. Finally, a third research prospect I have is to study transportation-based accidents around the world and engineer a deterrent to the problem. Each one of these goals closely aligns with a module of the UN Global Health vision of 2030. 
	I am interested in being an Ignite Maker and working with the Center for Global Health Technologies because it places innovation in the context of helping globally affected people. Often times technological advancements target commercial markets and don‚Äôt truly address large and longstanding issues. But by being an Ignite student, I can create a foundation in engineering that specifically targets underserved demographics. 
","        Papers flew across the room, names were yelled, and fear was buzzing in the air. My robotics team had finally made our dreams come true: making it to the World Championships. In 2 short weeks, we would be performing on the international stage, something we had only dreamed of. Yet after months of preliminary processes, hoping for this very opportunity, we now found ourselves struggling to repair our machine. With parts breaking, code malfunctioning, and morale at an all-time low, our team was slowly falling apart.
	After a week of struggling, the comments began. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we fix this?‚Äù, said a coder. Followed by a scattered set of nods. Next, an engineer, saying, ‚ÄúIf I could reduce the torque, we‚Äôd solve the battery problem.‚Äù Echoed by a roomful of agreeing nods. Slowly seeing more and more people chime in, I myself joined the conversation, commenting on the problems that I faced. As heads started to perk up and conversations opened, the air was once again buzzing; not with fear, but with potential. 
	Discussing the problems we were facing and expressing our thoughts on parts of our machine, we slowly delved into our work. At first, laying the problem out in front of us, we were able to slowly break it down and understand the interconnection of our jobs. Working for hours on end, we broke into groups and began solving an aspect of the problem. After a weekend of working together, our team huddled together with held breaths as we tested our robot. Seeing our machine carefully perform each action, we were able to observe our contributions before our eyes. As our robot made the final move of its routine, we quite literally jumped with joy, sobered at seeing our struggles finally translate into success. And just 5 days later, we once again jumped with joy; this time, from making it to the World Finals. 
	As students, we‚Äôre prone to fear. Through the days in robotics that we struggled, it was the shift from dealing with it personally, to communicating as a team that allowed us to succeed and take the international stage. Laying the problem directly before us, we were able to understand how we could each contribute to a solution, generating a stronger and more cohesive team. Not in spite of our struggles, but because of them.

Knowing assemblies were always quite boring and the teaching staff would just go on and on about stuff I did not really care about, for a change, I felt that day was going to catalyse an inner change within me. And it really did. 

I remember how striking it was for me to see that Poland‚Äôs efforts were not strong enough - how many of these 17 goals from the list shown on the humongous screen my tiny eyes could barely grasp, were clearly being overlooked. How many of these goals I thought Poland was doing enough for, such as green areas for ecosystem preservation. This moment released many emotions in me, because it felt like a part of me was awakened by knowledge I was not aware of before. Hence, I think the moment that I saw this list covered in a colour, which brings out connotation of death, I knew I had to create and do the change and focus on specific goals I thought, and still think today, I can contribute towards.

I strongly believe that was the moment UN Sustainable Development Goals became important to me; when the importance of them was slammed in-front of the face of a smaller me. ","Due to my interests in biomedical engineering, I am specifically interested in the field of bioimaging and biodesign. My route and path towards getting to my passions for biomedical engineering, and how it can revolutionise the medical industry, started with my interest in genetic modification, specifically CRISPR technologies and how they can combat mental and psychiatric disorders. I have done research on how CRISPR can help with depression, and now I am working on a research paper connected to CRISPR and ADHD. Both mental health disorders relevant in my family, thus issues that I care about, vastly due to their importance in my every day family life. 

Furthermore, that is why I am interested in working with the Center for Global Health Technologie as an Ignite Maker; I want to broaden my medical and Health related interests. I want to suplement the change needed for my country, as well as others, to working towards the success of the UN SDGs. I hope I can work on a project that will be able to connect my interests for finding out medical solutions for problems people may think are not so medical after all. 

I have done the Youth in Biomedical Engineering Summer Programme run by Youth Inventa this summer, completed the ‚ÄúI am a Young Sustainability Champion Programme‚Äù and received a badge of achievement and completion, as well as have gotten and participated in the quarter finals of the Climate Science Olympiad; I strongly believe that these recent achievement will allow me to make the most out of becoming an Ignite Maker. All of these programmes and awards have allowed me to enhance skills such as ambition, resilience, determination and teamwork to get the most out of your biomedical engineering related programme for this academic school year. ","Tired, I opened my laptop and logged on to teams after receiving and enthusiastic message from my friend - ‚ÄúMarysia I am doing this.‚Äù 

To be honest with you, we did not really know what we were going to do; what we knew was that, my friend and I, loved to write and popularise science. Hence, on a late afternoon, actually very late (2 hours towards midnight), Nicola and I catalysed the creation of Innovation Hub - a youth-led Science magazine platform, where young inventors, makers and scientists can contribute and get their written work out there, whilst supporting the UN‚Äôs effort of Goal 4 - Quality Education. 

After a 3 hour long call, with eye bags nearly reaching the end of both our faces, we have managed to create the website for Innovation Hub. Despite many mistakes and difficulties we encountered, such as getting the url name for the website and designing its colour choice, we recovered from them quite quickly - that is what I refer to as perseverance. 
    This teamwork and perseverance shown, carried as along with my friend Nicola, towards collaborating with over 15 members from more than 10 countries, releasing our first biannual issue, publishing award-winning research and most importantly, creating what we saw as lacking in other science communication platforms we have sought to participate in; Innovation Hub is more than a collective, engaging and connecting platform publishing science work - it is a social project grown from pure science passions working towards creating change and becoming doers. Innovation Hub is the unique opportunity for youth like us, who want to get their work out there, but do not know where to start. Frankly here, it is quite simple, just shoot us an email at innovation hub.world@gmail.com!

Specifically, due to the fact that my country lacks opportunities like that for high schoolers to conduct research and gain scientific extracurricular options outside the classroom, I believe that Ignite has really changed that and I would love to participate next year. ","The most difficult part for me was motivating myself to actually write my research review paper. It has taken a lot of time for me to do it and not procrastinate. Without doubt, I would participate in the programme again. ","The UN sustainable development goal of my choice would be goal number 4 relating to quality education; I am very fortunate to be in a school in Poland, where an English curriculum is offered, and I hope that in the future more youngsters and poles around the world will be able to participate in programs such as Ignite and attend schools such as mine. ",I would still love to do something related to biomedical research and biomedical engineering. Ignite has helped me realize that and the different things I have gained because I am able to participate in Ignite. ,Get more people from Europe so that the time zones align and I could attend zoom calls. ,
208,Noreen  Majeed,Noreen ,Majeed,She/her/hers,14,Freshman/9th,Asian,Raleigh Charter High School,Cary,27519,previous Ignite participant,Pre-medicine,4,Good Health,"I have had my fair share of doctor‚Äôs offices,  been sick numerous times, had consecutive doctor visits, was poked and prodded, administered shots and medicines,  overall an unpleasant experience. Now, as I have gotten older, I realize why all of those tears were worth it, they were small increments of keeping me safe and healthy for the long run.  It‚Äôs not just about staying fit, or eating healthy- there is so much more to it, good health means balancing your physical, social, and mental well-being. Studies have shown a direct correlation to a positive outlook toward life, meaningful social interactions, and pushing through setbacks with a more optimistic view. I personally have realized that staying healthy transpired to being energized and happier with my day-to-day life. This experience in my own life, of transforming my own health encouraged a new dream of mine- to inspire the same healthy change in others. While I have been fortunate to receive the best possible care, it sadly is not the state of the world. 

As the statistics from UN Sustainable Development Goals states, ‚ÄúCOVID 19 has caused devastating effects on the world, threatening decades of progress in global health including 500 million infected, disrupted health services in 92% of countries, halted progress on universal health care, decreased global life expectancy, and more devastating consequences.‚Äù These numbers show how we truly have a serious problem on our hands. The world's health, right as we have the ability to change it for the better, is declining into a global crisis due to our indifference towards the effects of the recent pandemic that are slowly coming upon us. If this rate continues, it puts global health in a devastating place with children not receiving vital vaccines, increased disease rates, no health coverage or equipment needed to treat patients, and prevalence of anxiety/depression. 

My passion is to change the global health state for people of all ages anywhere, specifically related to the UN target- to strengthen the capacity of all countries against disease outbreaks and maintain good national health especially in developing countries. An experience I have had related to this is witnessing a developing country with poor community health. Due to my family heritage, I have visited India multiple times in my life and it truly inspires you to push for change. In many underprivileged areas, chronic illness is visible on the streets mainly without having access to healthcare and thousands die due to this. My aunt who completed medical school in India tells her first-hand experience of how patients would have survived and gone on to live a healthy life if government funded medical facilities had even half of the facilities available in the United States. Along with this, equipment, medication, surgical facilities, and affordability are lacking, making life for those living in India taxing  from catching a cold to having a life changing disease such as cancer. Hearing and witnessing these first hand experiences have empowered me to push for global change in healthcare.
","I have contemplated hard and found purpose in making an impact through medicine. The medical field has always interested me as the discoveries that have come from the field have drastically changed the world as we know it. Among the various medical specialties, I have always been drawn to the research of infectious diseases. I believe by delving into this field and making progress towards the eradication of disease I can make the biggest difference towards improving global health, by creating these treatment methods but also making them available to developing countries, providing equitable access to healthcare, effectively reaching my aspirations while still pursuing a career I am deeply interested in. 

After high school, I would like to pursue pre-medicine, and  I am confident that  this path allows me to have a personal value to changing lives in my day to day life. The core of medicine is service and serving others before yourself, a value I connect to. I believe there is a real difference between just treating patients and being motivated to alleviate their pain and suffering while ensuring they lead a healthier life in the future. Keeping this in mind,  I would like to change healthcare to focus more on patients and helping them lead better lives rather than funding the corporate world. 

I am hoping that my career choice will provide me with the opportunity to build upon my purpose by assisting others to stay healthy both physically and mentally, a vital element into being able to achieve individual goals and their own purpose in life. To me, this encompasses everything from the little things like putting a smile on their face to the big things such as helping them overcome a life-limiting illness. Beyond this, I would like to make a worldwide impact by improving community health through research to help limit the impact of future pandemics, pro-active vaccine development including for those who are immunocompromised, and so much more that can help us come together as a stronger, healthier community. Many of the milestones along the way (such as IGNITE) can help me achieve this dream.

I believe that the IGNITE program can provide me with a major stepping stone on my career path. The STEM-based environment will allow me to grow and learn with like-minded people that can help maximize my potential in a collaborative environment. The mentors there will allow me to be pushed to achieve my best while still receiving proper tutelage from those well-versed in the medical field. I believe IGNITE  will allow me to get a proper experience in the medical field, interacting with medical professionals, researching medical developments, putting research into reality to create a project and many other experiences that can help me confirm my presence and truly make a difference in the medical field. Also, I have connected with the DGLHI‚Äôs especially to their program which encourages the youth of our generation to pursue their passion projects. A project I found interesting was the research to detect viral threats earlier, in particular those who started with animals and have the capability to become a pandemic. Creating these connections between the animals and infectious diseases fascinates me as we come to a new discovery in the field, predicting diseases and preparing for them. Relating to this personally, I am motivated to delve into research towards diseases with IGNITE to create life-changing discoveries that adhere to DGLHI‚Äôs vision- global equitable health care.
","In 2020 during the midst of the COVID pandemic,  I joined Schoolhouse.world(SHW) a free peer-to-peer tutoring platform founded by Sal Khan (from Khan Academy)  as a tutor in the hopes of helping children both locally and on a global scale gain access to free, quality education at a time when the pandemic challenged traditional educational modalities. After tutoring a few sessions, I was ecstatic from the multitude of positive feedback and more importantly, it felt good to help others get what I believe is a basic right to education but I still felt incomplete. I wanted to make a more meaningful impact, and I felt I could do it best by helping at Schoolhouse‚Äôs core- the volunteering side of the platform, I applied and contributed to teams such as onboarding, auditing, and user support. For a few months, all was going well as I hosted sessions and completed my volunteering roles in tandem. 

Then, abruptly, both user-support co-leads left leaving the team in pieces. User support is key to keeping the platform functioning on a daily basis. Team members started to drop their duties, the team was no longer connected, and had no leadership. Despite this, I tried to keep some resemblance of normality by completing assigned tasks, took on the assignments left behind by members not fulfilling their roles and hosting team bonding to make us more connected.

 Then, the biggest surprise occurred when the product team lead of SHW thrust me into a role that I was wholly unprepared for - User Support Team Lead. In the beginning, I was only equipped with the knowledge as a team member and had to learn the team‚Äôs internal workings while juggling the role's challenges. It was (and still is) a challenging role and at times I contemplated giving up but I steeled myself by remembering the platform's impact and my connected passion to expand SHW‚Äôs reach so more could gain access to free tutoring . I also realized that I needed to earn the team's trust and that was not going to be easy considering my lack of experience and the sense of abandonment from the prior team leads.

I launched a full project to bring the team together involving tracking to ensure everyone‚Äôs duties had been completed, weekly team syncs, and virtual team bondings, and utilized more experienced members and my product team supervisor to bring the team back on course. Despite this plan, we continued to have problems(like every team) but when problems arose we brainstormed as a team to find creative solutions that could overcome challenges. To quote a specific situation, one day we had an influx of chats coming in about missed sessions (due to tutor no-shows) and people started to get frustrated- missing out on vital tutoring help. The User Support team rallied together and used everyone‚Äôs varied teaching strengths to host sessions for every person who had missed out on help due to a tutor no-show. From this situation, we were able to come together as a team of merely a few dozen people through grit and perseverance and portray a united front for SHW.  These experiences helped us come closer together  as a team, and the role is a reminder of the lesson to push past boundaries and maximize your team‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses, and individual empowerment to create meaningful impacts.

Their feedback helped me develop my critical thinking, design, tinkering and so many other skills. These lessons can be taken with me for all my future projects.",I think it was difficult to give up my topic of diabetes because of my anxiety towards building a physical prototype. This uncertainty towards actually engineering a design was difficult for me to overcome in the IGNITE Make program.,"Health is the most important to me because not only does it affect the physical body it also affects emotional and mental health. The prevention of chronic diseases helps me give back to my community by providing them with a better lifestyle. Beyond this, they are proven to become happier and enjoy life with good health motivating me to make that impact on as many as I can. ",It has not changed by college and career goals of pursuing medicine in light of helping others rather strengthened that goal. I am now even more passionate about medicine especially since I now have a few more skills thanks to the program that I can put towards that topic. ,I would love more in-person meetings ex: at Duke campus rather than always meeting on Zoom or only having in person meetings for building. I feel like it would help build a better sense of community!,
209,Prisha Rathi,Prisha,Rathi,She/her/hers,17,Senior/12th,Asian,Enloe Magnet High School,Apex,27523,Email,Biomedical Engineering,4,Good Health,"Achieving good health for the world requires the confluence of many different fields. Sure, supporting good health can mean the development of biomedical innovations to better health in a clinical setting, but it can also lead to innovations that can be used in countries with limited healthcare resources. There, local language translators and focus groups need to be involved to make sure the device is intuitive, engineers need to be involved to make sure the device works in areas riddled with power cuts, sustainable support needs to be created to upkeep devices, and so much more. 
The interdisciplinary connections required in the health field is what draws me to it. I have always had very varied interests, ranging from fine arts to computer engineering, and there is never quite one discipline that allows me to incorporate the diversity of perspective I harbor, as well as allowing me to collaborate with peers from different areas. However, the field of health encompasses the gamut of my interests, allowing me to design, build, and innovate without bounds, with new, interesting research and complexities rolling in by the hour.
Of course, as someone interested in good health, I am also drawn to the fact that  improving health outcomes means helping people achieve their maximum potential. The devices I hope to create should improve people‚Äôs lives so that they can be healthy and become productive members of society. Additionally, creating these innovations in good health doesn‚Äôt only help the target audience of the product, but rather contributes to the ocean of knowledge in biomedical technologies. Becoming a stepping stone for future innovators that come up with devices that can further better the world is another overarching goal of mine, and I hope to achieve it by working in this field.","Currently, I am dual enrolled in Wake Tech to get my Associates in Engineering. I hope to then transfer to a four year college for a bachelors in Biomedical Engineering, eventually going to graduate school and potentially beyond. I eventually hope to design biomedical devices to create advances in my particular interests: low cost imaging technology, soft robotics, and neural/retinal prosthetics.
While attending a Duke BME course during the summer of 2021, I first learnt about CGHT and the low-cost technologies they were creating to be implemented in rural areas. This really struck a chord within me as I also volunteer for CORD (Chinmaya Organization for Rural Development), which creates sustainable programs in the Indian subcontinent that deal with everything from health education to empowering women through employment. BME has always held a place in my heart due to its fusion of so many of my interests (engineering, medicine, and design) but putting BME devices to  help humanity is what truly makes me want to work in this field for the rest of my life. Being able to work with the CGHT to achieve this meaningful combination would allow me to create a solid foundation on which I can base my future college innovations. I can also contribute to CGHT innovations with my robotics and art background. As part of my robotics design team, one of our main focuses is constantly iterating our design to be faster and more precise, as CGHT does with cost and precision. In art, I often investigate the power of simplicity within my pieces. Being able to transfer that critical eye over to CGHT would be key in creating simpler, cost-effective designs.
Additionally, for my International Baccalaureate Extended Essay, I am researching the implementation of BME devices in low/middle income countries, focusing specifically on the cultural and linguistic barriers in the use of technology. Being able to work with the CGHT to design a device with these barriers in mind would give me a lot of insight in coming up with new ideas to overcome them. ","As a member of student council, I was assigned as the lead of decorations for prom planning. One of the problems I encountered was coordinating the supplies and team I needed in a much shorter time frame than expected. 
The first part of the problem was acquiring the supplies for prom on such short notice. To fix this, a lot of persistent emailing and countless lunches and mornings were dedicated to letting my teacher supervisors know what supplies I needed and how I could get them at the earliest.
The next part was assembling the team I needed to both plan and create all the decorations for prom. Although our initial team was a group of 6 students to oversee planning, disinterest and conflicting schedules had whittled my workforce down to two  people as soon as crunch time started. To overcome this, I rallied more people from my council to join decorations and involved several volunteer, art, and calligraphy clubs in making decorations. With the incentive of volunteer hours and many instructive slideshows, I trained many students in making decorations, more than remedying the problem. Specifically, I made sure to ask for and take ideas from the art club to decorate prom so that we could get a more universally appealing and inclusive design. Making sure other people‚Äôs perspectives were included was one of my main tools to make sure prom looked magical in everyone‚Äôs eyes, not just mine.
The final part of the problem was assigning people to the jobs that they would do on the day of prom. Between cancellations from key members and a very distracted group of helpers, one of the main examples of my perseverance came from consistently keeping my small group on track, so that we could finish the setup on time. By making sure plans were clearly outlined and decorations were neatly organized, installation of all the pieces went smoothly and ended up finishing earlier than planned. 
Ultimately, taking on this problem gave me a lot of valuable lessons and my perseverance helped achieve the goal of executing our school‚Äôs biggest prom in one of the shortest time frames.",Y,8/19/22,Prisha Rathi,Female,pre,Evaluating because it allows communities to share feedback and needs that the prototype has  to take into account in the future,All of the above are viable solutions to the new need,Listen to the community,Define,"Focus on community goals because goals, like problems, require attention and effort","Feasibility- will it be an affordable option for people?,Desirability- does the design solve a problem?,Viable- is it a short or long-term solution for the problem?",Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,No Opinion,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,70,80,80,80,70,70,70,80,70,"Since I have had some experience in the design process before (robotics, hackathons, PLTW classes), I feel fairly comfortable as a baseline in most aspects of the design process.

That was incredibly fun and gave me the motivation to see myself through the prototyping and presenting sides of the project.,"Coming with a unique niche to tackle. It would be nice if we started the maker program out by researching common issues and maybe talking to some guest speakers about some unsolved problems they had? I felt supported through our listen phase to find problems in my community, but I definitely felt at points that I would be doing something that overlapped with an existing technology too much.","Yes, 100%. Health is incredibly vast, spanning not just human care, but social justice, economic problems, environmental problems, and so much more. It is so entwined with our life because the field literally concerns our life, and I still find myself very motivated to make more technologies for the health sector.","A little-- previously, I was set on going into industry after biomedical engineering, but I found through the program that I shone in researching and designing solutions rather than being the hands-on creator. Now, I plan on doing a more research heavy academia route, potentially trying to become a professor and have a lab eventually.",I would add more curriculum and potentially some guest speakers! Getting to know more broad and concrete problems within the community as well as learning more granularly about all the usability factors to consider when making a device would be incredibly useful.,I am planning on going to Johns Hopkins for biomedical engineering!

The idea that plants, light, or excrement could be used as fuel was something that I was fascinated by. In the second grade I knew nothing of what global warming was or how petrol is used in cars. These ideas were distant and I was not conscious of my environmental decisions. Seminars throughout elementary and middle school told students to shut off water and stop using unnecessary light around the house. That was all I had to do to play my part in stopping the impending ecological downfall of the planet. As I grew up and saw my home country, I knew that there was much more to the problem than that. In Haiti, my conveniences turned into luxuries. Indoor plumbing, electricity and air conditioning were things that I had never second-guessed having in America.
I want to make a place for my family residing in Haiti where these conveniences are no longer luxuries. I want them to have access to clean, cheap energy that can power their houses and appliances. Their struggle inspires me to learn more and help them overcome the many systems placed against them.","Computer Science has been my main goal of study since my first year of middle school. Now that I am about to graduate, I need to know what concentration that I am going to work in. By trying a little of each branch of computer science, I have learned that I want to use this form of study to help others. I want to work on research that helps to prevent or locate disease in patients. By working with the Center for Global Health Technologies I could help realize those dreams by doing research.
Currently I want to research in artificial intelligence. I believe that AI could be used in medical devices to observe sequences or patterns of illness within individuals and create a diagnosis based on this. I want to help create tools that can do this and more as an Ignite Maker.","Currently I work as a Mu Alpha Theta officer and I am in charge of helping our club get the people that it needs to thrive. Our school prides itself on being a school focused on technology and sciences, so those that do not excel in those areas tend to be discouraged to join clubs that focus on either of those areas. Many are afraid of being wrong.
As an officer, my team and I created plans that tried to include all levels of math. We created problems and games so that students would learn to enjoy math again. It is hard after being in an enviroment that shames you for being wrong, to join somewhere else that encourages you to try anyways. Knowing that, we continued on to create a fun program for those at our school to enjoy.
