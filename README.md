It is important to note that, for example, in the case of Learners, different questions were asked each year, which may not be included in all years. Therefore, for columns such as `Season`, `Wk1 Style`, or `Health: I would be willing to join community heart and lung health initiatives, such as volunteer opportunities`, there will not be responses for all years. 

For a detailed view of these columns, please refer to the file named **"Column comparison"** located in the folder **"40_finalDatasets"**.
