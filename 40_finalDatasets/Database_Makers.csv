Growing up, I felt highly sheltered, protected by the wall that my parents built from the real world. However, after I moved from Illinois to North Carolina in 7th grade, I was exposed to countless diverse and new faces. When school began, I made many friends, all with unique personalities, interests, and charms. As our friendships deepened, the protective barriers my parents had created crumbled, exposing some of the monstrous, cruel, and painful realities of life. My friends shared their problems, and ones not between us, but inside themselves. I was shocked by the internal conflicts churning their stomach and driving them to commit desperate acts. One of my closest friends attempted suicide, and was rushed to the hospital to be stabilized. Confronting such issues head on made me feel both sad and guilty: sad for their pain, and guilty that I was unaware of the struggles hiding behind a smile. I started to wonder if other people I know face similar problems. As I researched further, I realized mental health issues are common among family and friends. Mental and global health are important to me for many reasons, but it holds a special place in my heart that drives me to do better for others. While I grew up privileged, some people donâ€™t have access to aid, or are afraid to be recognized as weak. I would like to help others deal with this crisis, overcome their struggles, and continue with their lives carefree. 
","For as long as I can remember, I have always had a deep found love for medicine.  Maybe itâ€™s the joy from helping others and seeing a patient's family relieved, or maybe itâ€™s something as simple as diving deep into the unknown workings of our body. No matter what the case is, I am certain that I want to eventually become a physician. From seeing my cousins and extended family first hand, I know the journey is long and hard, but I am determined to overcome this challenge. They say â€œgo big, or go home,â€ right? Well my â€œbigâ€ goal is to go to an excellent medical school and subsequently begin practicing. But until I am eligible to apply, I plan to build my skill set by working on passion projects, volunteering around a hospital, and learning more about the human body. I aim to apply for a combined BS/MD program so that I can devote time to other subjects and seamlessly transition into medical school. By the time I am done with education, I aspire to work in a well-known hospital. I want to make the incurable curable and focus specifically on brain tumors, brain cancers, and neurological disabilities. By working with the Center for Global Health Technologies as an Ignite Maker, I can develop my ability to research independently and bring my ideas to life while also collaborating and learning from talented peers.
","One of my favorite pastimes is baking. Though many people believe that baking is easy, in reality it is highly tedious and easy to mess up. For my older sisterâ€™s 16th birthday, I began preparing her cake a day early, starting by measuring and laying out all the ingredients. My twin brother agreed to help me, and soon we were working as a team to efficiently mix the batter. As I waited for the cakes to finish baking in the oven, I was imagining the salivating delicacy that would await us at the end. After waiting for the layers to cool, my brother agreed to do the dishes while I began adding thick frosting and cherries in between. Thinking the cake had cooled fully, I let go of the support, only to painfully watch the layers crack down the middle, like an earthquake splitting the street. I was devastated, and my initial reaction was immense disappointment. After regaining composure, I decided there was nothing more I could do, and put the cake in the fridge, promising to return to it tomorrow. The next day, I was shocked to see it back in one piece. As I asked around what had happened, I found out that my mom had magically â€œsmushedâ€ the two pieces together. Overjoyed, I took this opportunity as a second chance to make my sisterâ€™s day. Ignoring immediate schoolwork, I continued working on the assembly and decoration for another three hours, grateful to my teamâ€“ my familyâ€“ for helping make it happen. At the end of the day, we all came together to eat the black forest cake, the fruit of our collective labor.

201,Alexandra Xie,Alexandra,Xie,She/her/hers,15,Sophomore/10th,Asian,Green Hope High School,Cary,27513,previous Ignite participant,Biology/Health Science,4.375,Ignite Makers,Good Health,"The UN sustainable Development Goal includes a total of seventeen goals which summarizes the necessary endeavors for a better world, and calls for people to eliminate the crisis happening around us. 
The SDG that I chose was good health. It is important to me because I am eager to help people with illnesses and disabilities. Nowadays, many diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, high blood-pressure and more, have started to dig their claws into more people and even the younger generations. These illnesses are limiting people's abilities to do many things; but I believe that we deserve healthy, functional bodies that allow us to do whatever we wish. This is an issue I want to help with. I want to learn more about health topics and study how to make designs that solve peopleâ€™s needs.
","I am interested in working in the medicine or health care field in the future; this leads to me thinking about what I can do right now, as a highschool student, to make a difference for all the people around me. Research wise, I am interested in mental health diseases, such as anxiety disorders.
If I could create a prototype of a human-based design that resolves health concerns in daily life, it would be a huge deal to me, because I have a passion for helping people. However, I am still in school and I need help from those with experiences to guide me, which is why I want to work with the Center for Global Health Technologies. For the past two years I have participated in the Ignite Maker Program, and I learned many things: the real process of creating a project, how to make your visions come true step by step, and how to research more efficiently. I would like to continue learning and improving my abilities to engineer and more by joining Ignite again this year. I enjoy creating something that is fully mine from scratch, and refining the design as I go along; in the end, I feel very satisfied for being able to improve my project and presenting the best of what I could have. I like working as an engineer, so that is another reason why I am hoping to join Ignite. 
","Battle of the Books was a club in my middle school for avid readers; at the end of the year, we must compete with each other by answering related questions. I was really confident and excited to win this, so I read my books quickly. However, my friend was behind and it made me really mad because I felt like she would drag me down. Later, I pulled her aside and questioned her; yet she told me that, like me, she also wanted to win so badly, but she simply didnâ€™t have time because of her school work and strict schedule. I realized that I had to not just think for myself, but also had to put myself in her shoes. After that argument, I helped her with reading and homework, and she immediately made progress. At last, we did the competition in the media center. We lost, even though we tried our best. But surprisingly, I wasnâ€™t really that sad. Because of helping that friend, I got really close with her and I learned an important lesson: when working with others for a common goal, you must work together, think about others, and not make it about yourself. Sometimes winning isnâ€™t the ultimate goal. 
During this time, I thought of giving up and leaving the competition. I thought that there was no point in practicing because we would lose anyway. But I wanted to finish what I started, no matter how difficult it gets. When working in a group, different opinions would be inevitable. I know that instead of denying each other, we must listen to each other and find a way to solve the issue together.

There will never be too many mountains to hike, lakes to swim in, or fields to watch the sunrise in. Experiencing and interacting with nature is so important to people, for regulation and growth.

I want to do everything I can to make sure nature stays intact for all generations to come and find peace in. I want younger generations to be able to understand just how much going outside and non-ironically touching grass can help you. These days, the future is technology. We wake up to phone alarms, eat breakfast scrolling through social media, work on computers, and more. Our connection to technology is detaching us from nature. Nature holds so much energy that we leave unharnessed. I want to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development goal because I want to protect the resources that helped me and have shaped my future goals. I want to do what I can to make sure nature is protected and available for many generations to come. I want to harness natureâ€™s pure potential so that our growing technology can be sustained while our environment is protected. After all, who is going to invent when there is no environment for them to thrive on? ","In college, I hope to pursue a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Environmental Science. With my Masters degree, I hope to have a job as an environmental engineer or a water quality engineer. To support my future goals, I am primarily interested in research that dives into climate and environmental issues with potential engineering solutions. Working with the Center for Global Health Technologies as an Ignite Maker aligns with my interests to research and propose potential solutions to an environmental issue. The guidance and knowledge of professionals will not only support the foundations of my research, but also teach me how to work through the research process and hurdles to present realistic solutions. Being an Ignite Maker goes beyond anything an AP class or a textbook can teach me. I want to be able to use skills Iâ€™ve learned through my 11 years in school and apply them to a project that could present a solution to part one of our worldâ€™s most pressing issues. Being involved in a project where I can put my ideas, opinion, and knowledge forth to bring something that could improve our lives is something I have been passionate about since I first became interested in mechanical engineering and the environment. I want to be an Ignite Maker not only because of the potential I could present to the world, but also to maximize my personal and professional potential. Pursuing research with guidance and mentorship will allow me to grow intellectually, so that in the future I am equipped with the experience to propel my projects to the finishing point I dream of. As a potential Ignite Maker, I am optimistic about the opportunity I have to fuel my personal growth, current research hopes, and future projects. ","One time I showed perseverance and teamwork was earlier this year during robotics. I am part of an FRC team local to RTP, and itâ€™s currently my second year on the team. If you donâ€™t know anything about FRC, we spend 7 weeks starting January after we get our game with rules and goals building a robot to compete. With robots that weigh in at 100 pounds and can climb monkey bars, teams dedicate a lot of time to planning and building. With that time we commit, students grow to either like or tolerate their teammates. Naturally, not everyone is going to like everyone, so problems arise. One of the problems my team faced was that instead of being a place that encourages interest in STEM and chooses leaders based on passion and mindset, we started picking leaders based on connections and who is friends with whom. As a rookie, it was off-putting seeing people who deserved to be leading get kicked to the curb. Because of poor leadership, our performance was dropping to levels we hadnâ€™t been since COVID. I wondered if it was just me reading too much into things, so I asked other rookies if they had noticed what was going on. The others agreed, but they were too scared to speak up. So I went to the veterans on the team and asked if they had realized. They too acknowledged it, but again, they were too scared to speak up. Hearing everyone say they were worried they wouldnâ€™t be able to get a leadership position or scared to have a bad reputation on the team made me worried. I would be lying if I said I wasnâ€™t scared that I might not be able to reach my full potential on the team, and others would be held back too. Robotics was something I joined at first because my mom told me to, but after spending time on the team I realized how much joy it brought me. I remember the moment I realized I loved robotics, and every day on the team makes me love it more. Robotics became the highlight of my day, and it helped me realize what I wanted to do in college and the future. So I was terrified that one thing would lead to another, and robotics would no longer be a part of my life. But I realized that itâ€™s wrong to stay quiet when I see people on my team struggle with something that can be fixed with a simple discussion. I emailed all of our mentors and wrote everything that Iâ€™d noticed and heard. I talked to everyone who held the same position and told them that as a team, our teamâ€™s culture and environment is just as important as our performance. Working with everyone, we managed to talk to each other as a team, and are currently implementing solutions that are making our team not just a better place for us, but also for future students.

202,Ankitaa Radhakrishnan,Ankitaa,Radhakrishnan,She/her/hers,15,Sophomore/10th,Asian,Green Level High School,"Cary NC, USA ",27519,Family member,,4,Ignite Makers,Good Health,"  The UN's Sustainable Development Goal of good health has always been important to me. Growing up being surrounded by different types of doctors in my family, I have gained a fascination and passion toward the field of medicine. As a child, I was in awe of doctors, viewing them as real-life superheroes who healed the sick and mended the broken. This summer, I was so very grateful to get an opportunity to intern at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre in Kerala, India. From the moment I set foot in the hospital, I knew that medicine was my calling. This experience ignited a spark within me, and since then, my passion for medicine has grown exponentially. Witnessing the suffering of individuals in their most vulnerable moments evoked a deep empathy within me. 

     I remember visiting one young boy in the Pediatric Oncology ward, who had been diagnosed with leukemia. His leukemia was worsening rapidly, and the only option left was a bone marrow transplant. Unfortunately, his parents weren't financially stable and couldn't provide their son with this necessary procedure. His doctor told him that he was getting better day by day to keep the young boy happy. It broke my heart to see the true happiness on his face when the doctor told him he was recovering. Little did he know, this was far from the truth. This is the moment I was struck with the harsh realization of pain  and suffering. 

     Since then, I yearned to do more than simply empathize; I want to be their superhero. I want to see the smile on their faces to finally have survived the hardest struggles of life. Medicine is a very fascinating topic to me and I am becoming more and more curious each day to grow my knowledge in this field. ","After my four years of High School, I aspire to continue my education in a university, majoring in medicine. My grandmother has been a true inspiration to me. I lived in India for almost two years and I remember her having to wake up at five AM, rushing to the hospital and returning home past midnight. I used to look up at her in awe and amazement, and now I plan on doing the same exact thing when I grow up. 

As of research, I took part in a two-week internship called Biotech in-Action. During this program, I did research on a neurodegenerative disease called spinocerebellar ataxia. I designed an app and an invention to help treat and manage the symptoms you face while fighting against this disease. I would love to do more research on this subject and other health-related topics, and that is why I am super excited about this program!

I am so immensely excited to get to work with the Center for Global Health Technologies as an Ignite maker because I see that research related to cancer is being done at Duke. At my school, I am vice president of the club called Green Level Cancer Society, and we aim to provide care packages and other goodies to young patients who are diagnosed with cancer. I love helping out behind the scenes and making the patients feel loved and cared for, but I also think that this is a great opportunity for me to see how the research and invention part of it runs as well. ","An instance where I showed teamwork and perseverance to solve a problem was a couple of months ago when the rest of the leadership board and I were trying to hold a fundraiser for our school club. It was really challenging to gain enough money to buy care packages for patients, and we began losing hope. After two months of trying and still not making it to our goal, we decided to conquer and divide the work in order to spread the word farther than our little friend circuit. A few of us started spreading the word in our neighborhoods by knocking on doors and advertising, while others hung up signs all across the school hallways. This way, our community began to gradually grow, and more and more people were willing to take part in the cause. Eventually, we got just over 300 people to enter into our raffle fundraiser and we finally exceeded our goal money. Thanks to the rest of the board and all our neighbors, friends, and family, we were able to provide care packages and other goodies to patients at an organization called CancerKidsFirst.

203,Anwitha Kumbham,Anwitha,Kumbham,She/her/hers,16,Junior/11th,Asian,Heritage High School,Frisco,75035,previous Ignite participant,Biomedical Engineering,4,Ignite Entrepreneurs,Good Health,"59 days, 1416 hours, or 84960 minutes. Thatâ€™s approximately how long David Bennet survived with the heart of a pig in place of his cardiac organ. Googleâ€™s daily top 10 searches, an NPR article, and a hog led to my stubborn fascination and the prodding of my Biology teacher with questions. Directed down a rabbit hole of scientific journals following our conversation about artificial hearts as an alternative to xenotransplantation, my interest with the creation of an artificial heart and biomedically engineered organs was solidified, later opening the doors to biomedical engineering. The research and developments within this field continue to fascinate me, but my passion is fueled not only by my interest in future possibilities, but through personal experiences that continue to reinforce the importance of accessible opportunities for good health for all. 
Oftentimes, my visits with my grandparents and extended family in India ended not only with immense joy but a feeling of sadness. While I was grateful for any chance to see them, I was often saddened knowing that they lived in an area with limited resources, making it extremely hard to access medical help. Additionally, their financial ability also made it even harder to find affordable and accessible options much like the hundreds of people that lived in their village and across the country. 
By exploring this field through various summer programs and previously participating in the Ignite program, I was able to solidify my belief that the UN Sustainable Goal 3 for good health as the most important. Working on an indoor smoke inhalation detector as a Maker last year, I was not only able to explore engineering principles, but I was able to explore biomedical engineering by designing a device specifically targeting individuals living in similar situations to my grandparents. Good health remains a fundamental human right, something that I strive for through my work with Ignite â€“ to increase accessibility and affordability to medical technology.","Thereâ€™s a running joke in the Indian community that every child has the choice to become either a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer. While I donâ€™t fit those options exactly, I take my place in the little crevice of space between the words â€œdoctorâ€ and â€œengineer.â€ Through the field of biomedical engineering, Iâ€™ve been able to find an area of study that stretches itself between these careers while allowing me to explore the titles of â€œscientistâ€ and â€œresearcher.â€ My enamour with this field has proven itself over the years as my fascination with engineering and entrepreneurship only grew. Over the past year, my participation within the Ignite program has allowed me to explore biomedical engineering where I was able to focus my interest on working to further aid low-access communities through the creation of medical devices. Working on my smoke inhalation detector through the Ignite program as a Maker has given me the opportunity to learn fundamental engineering principles, develop research skills, and pushed me to innovatively approach problems to come up with effective solutions. Modeling this device with low-access communities in mind, my partner and I maintained accessibility and affordability at the forefront of our design. As I further my knowledge and experience within biomedical engineering, I hope to utilize the Ignite program to further develop upon my device from the previous year to make it more effective and functional while learning about the entrepreneurial aspects. Using the knowledge from my prior experiences within STEM and through the Ignite program as a foundation, I hope to study biomedical engineering in college before pursuing my M.B.A. or Ph.D. In the future, I hope to make contributions towards research in prosthetics or the development of devices to aid lower income communities to promote the accessibility of medical technology. The possibility of continuing my work with the Center for Global Health Technologies through Ignite excites me as I look forward to furthering my education within biomedical engineering and believe that this program will continue to shape me into a future engineer while pushing me to expand my knowledge. ","It would be simpleâ€¦right? â€œDesign bioengineering-based solutions to a real-world medical problemâ€ â€“ little did I know, that these were the 8 words that would plague my thoughts for the following weeks. After being assigned to complete a project by utilizing my knowledge on biomedical engineering and the biodesign process, my initial reaction of excitement soon turned into curiosity, later becoming worry. In the coming few weeks, I would find out that this project would not only influence my interests but even my career goals. After intensely researching, my partner and I were able to find a big issue; many people, oftentimes from impoverished and underprivileged areas, had no idea that they were even inhaling second-hand smoke. Our research showed that second-hand smoke contained over 7,000 chemicals, 250 of which are known human carcinogens that could cause cancer within the human body. We found that this second-hand smoke was often considered worse than inhaling primary smoke from cigarettes. After coming up with our needs statement, we quickly hit a wall, questioning our next steps. Continuing our research, we made some progress but still remained unsuccessful in being able to fully model our idea. After coming together to pool our work and knowledge, we were finally able to come together to begin and create our preliminary designs for the components of our device. Although it took hours of research, hard work, frustration, and often mini-debates within our team, we were able to successfully design and model our final device. Despite the hard work, I had realized that I had enjoyed every bit of it. The excitement of learning more about cancer and second-hand smoke, as well as the issues faced by those living in impoverished areas, such as my grandparents, only continued to fuel my passion for this topic but for biomedical engineering as a whole.

Lab coats swooshed across me, and the situation soon faded into oblivion. My grandma was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Tears streamed down my eyes as my grandmother passed away. At a young age, I realized obstacles are inevitable; however, reactions matter the most. Battling grief and coming to terms with her death only persisted in my passion for assisting others through medicine due to my grandmother passing from a medical error.

At a young age, I bitterly understood the vitality of healthcare accessibility. India is just one of the many third-world countries struggling with a vast population and a lack of medical assistance for all. Spreading accessibility to healthcare throughout underprivileged third-world countries eventually became my goal for the future. As a third-culture student, I had to make it my goal to improve the living conditions of others and to give back to my community, which allowed me to have such a privileged life. 

Eventually, the UNâ€™s Good health goal came close to my heart and my passion for medicine increased to great heights. One day I aspire to conduct free clinics within various underprivileged parts of the world and contribute my research with worldwide implications as a tribute to my grandmother and my community. Furthermore, I wish to extend my knowledge within science and learn about various topics such as regenerative medicine, neuroscience, and biomedical sciences to enlarge my impact on the world. I aspire to take steps toward furthering my passion and achieving my goal of minimizing the hardships faced by many underprivileged individuals.

At Green Level High School, my endless passion for science encouraged me to ponder possibilities and opportunities for my goal. DUKE Ignite is an opportunity to pursue my everlasting passion for research and a direct initiative to connect the UNâ€™s goal of good health and my goals for the future. Good health, therefore, is of crucial importance and may be achieved through this program in which I can implement my research ideas to create a worldwide impact.

Through this program, I hope to develop research applicable to the world in order to benefit the vulnerable populations within the rural villages in India who are diagnosed with blood and brain-based diseases ever too often. I hope to give back to the community and my family in India through the research I develop to possess worldwide implications with its core focus being on health.

","Science is a whirlwind of thoughts and ideas continuing to be built upon and grown. Despite barriers, science allows for growth despite making mistakes, allowing me to be true to myself and find new possibilities and ideas. The idea of problem-solving, creative thinking, and numerous trials fueled my passion for science. My hard work and dedication composed my desire to learn and advance throughout these years. Pursuing opportunities of my own assisted me in constructing my goals, broadening my view of the STEM society, and attaining knowledge through my passion for public health and science. 

This year e.coli prevention and lab experiences were exciting and essential to my research. Opportunities such as the North Carolina Student Academy of Science (NCSAS) and the North Carolina Science and Engineering Fair (NCSEF) enabled me to present my findings and excel in my area of research. As an ignite maker, collaboration with the Center for Global Health Technologies could assist me with my aspirations of becoming a biomedical researcher after attaining a degree in neuroscience and biomedical sciences at Duke University. 

 My research interest focuses on two different ideas with different approaches, both of which could offer global implications. The first idea is regarding the prevention of hemorrhagic stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke is the leading cause of many neurosurgery failures. My research focuses on creating a nanoparticle-induced treatment that crosses the blood-brain barrier - in the form of a gel- and binds to target blood vessels using peptides. If implemented, this research could provide benefits worldwide.

The second idea I hope to implement is easy testing to detect thalassemia. Thalassemia is a disease related to the blood in which the blood cells do not contain enough hemoglobin. My idea has to do with the easy detection of the disease. Since patients with thalassemia have different blood viscosity levels, we can use the difference in viscosity over a paper membrane to easily identify the disease. This would offer an easy and affordable testing method.  

As an ignite maker I will be able to make my aspirations regarding research become a reality. I believe that my research ideas will be able to make a difference in the world and assist many people across the globe. I will be able to make a great impact within the world by assisting those with hemorrhagic strokes and blood-based diseases with my current ideas; however I also believe that I can grow and open myself to various possibilities in the field of research such as Crispr technologies and e.t.c. Duke Ignite will be able to offer assistance through mentorship to fulfill my goals, develop my research, open possibilities to new ideas or expand on my current ones to make a difference in the world. 

","As a determined individual to find my path through a difficult year, curiosity enabled me to hone my skills and end successfully. These skills allowed me to submit my STEM Research club project from Green Level High School. 

This year, biomedical sciences and lab experiences were an interest and an essential part of me. I researched natural antibacterial compounds such as allicin, colloidal silver, and colloidal copper and their effect on E.coli. This study soon became a milestone in researching possibilities against antibacterial resistance. With the use of the Kirby Baur disk diffusion method, Allicin, in comparison to others, became the most effective against E.coli-based infections. Opportunities such as the North Carolina Student Academy of Science (NCSAS), and the North Carolina Science and Engineering Fair enabled me to present my findings to a panel of well-versed scientists winning first place. 

This path, however, was not always straightforward; it included lots of twists and turns. Throughout the project me and my partner struggled on every step of the pathway; however, we continued to persist through the difficulties enabling us to succeed. In the early stages of our project, my partner and I often struggled to find a mentor or supervisor because of the involvement of microbial agents. When we found a mentor, however, the mentor could only supervise during school hours. As high school students, we had to effectively balance school and the project. Coordinating with my partner and working on the project together became extremely challenging. However, we persevered and supported each other through it. 

Teamwork is not just the notion of working with another person. It is actively supporting that person, and understanding them from their perspective. If me and my partner had not understood each other's circumstances, we would have never been able to complete our project in time. 

Furthermore, in between the research project timeline, we faced a roadblock regarding the project. Our bacteria did not develop within our petri dish. In the midst of preparing for the competition, we couldn't process this as we had only a few weeks left before the deadline. Even though this could have hindered our goal to compete, my partner and I brainstormed ideas, created a new timeline to purchase materials, grow bacteria, write a research paper, present, and practice.

Ultimately, we put aside our differences, united for a common goal, and achieved it through teamwork and perseverance. Within this process, we were not only able to shine as individuals but as a team.

222,Jenny Yue,Jenny,Yue,She/her/hers,14,Freshman/9th,Asian,Green Level High School,Apex NC,27523,previous Ignite participant,,4,Ignite Makers,Clean Water,"After learning about the limited access to fresh water in middle school, I am very grateful for how lucky I am. I found out that water, something I once thought was plentiful, was so difficult to access in many places in the world. There are about 27% of people in the world that donâ€™t have access to clean water. I believe this is a problem more urgent than clean energy or good health because dehydration and waterborne diseases cause around 3.5 million deaths each year. In addition, the way we are using water is unsustainable in the long run. Overuse of water and water pollution is becoming an increasing problem, especially among second world countries.
 
My experience with the Ignite Learners program last year introduced me to the principles of human-centered designs. It's not just about any solutions solving any problems, but about ensuring these solutions are tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the communities they aim to help. I've learned that finding solutions in situations like these really matters. I believe that many communities really need a way to get clean and lasting water.
","When people ask about my future and career goals, I would often reply â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€. It's not because I'm uncertain about my passions, I love designing, engineering, and caring for the environment. But when it comes to specific job titles or paths, I'm still exploring. After all, I am only a rising freshman, and it is too early for me to decide. What I am certain about is the thrill I get from the process of problem-solving. Through experiences like the Ignite Learners program, the Future City Competition, and more, I solved different problems using this process. Starting with the challenge, understanding it, and then moving to designing and testing a solution gives me a sense of accomplishment that's hard to describe. I've also come to discover that I excel at defining problems, the most crucial step in problem solving in my opinion. If we don't truly understand a problem, how can we solve it? And worse, without proper clarity, we might end up taking steps in the wrong direction.

This leads me to the Ignite Makers program. I see it as the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into what I love while also refining my skills. I believe this program will help me connect the dots between my passion for engineering, the environment, and problem-solving, guiding me closer to the specific path I want to pursue.
","During our preparations for the ""Future City Competition,"" one of the biggest decisions we faced was selecting an optimal location for our designed city. I felt strongly that the Sahara region of Libya had unique potential. On the other hand, all of my other teammates, including the leaders, have a strong preference over New Zealand, primarily because of its green environment and ease of development.

I wanted to make sure every voice was heard, so they were all truly satisfied with the results. So I tried to understand the groupâ€™s collective inclination towards New Zealand. To convey this viewpoint, I dived deep into the research. I wanted to gather concrete data and compelling reasons that would highlight the advantages and opportunities Libya could offer. It took me a lot of time and effort, but I believe Libya is the better choice and is the only way we could stand a chance to win in the competition. Because of that, it wasnâ€™t too hard for me to push through long hours of research. 

Armed with my findings, I approached a few teammates who I felt might be leaning towards Libya. Together, we delved into discussions, weighing the pros and cons, and gradually, they began to share my enthusiasm for Libya. With their support, we initiated bigger group discussions. Using our combined research, we presented the benefits and the unique challenge that Libya presented. Over time, and through collaborative dialogue, more of our teammates warmed up to the idea.

In the end, our united team chose Libya, not just as a location, but as a testament to what can be achieved through perseverance, open-mindedness, and teamwork. This eventually leads us to better work together when building the model of the city. Throughout this process, it taught me that teamwork is not about someone that just works and says yes to something a leader said; it is an individual that could envision and achieve a goal together.

The study covered the worldwide decline in sperm count over the past 45 years, finding that sperm count has been dropping by an average of 2.64% percent each year after the year 2000 (Levine et al., 2022). This intrigued me, because decreasing sperm counts in men could have a large impact behind the decreasing fertility rates around the world. A low fertility rate means that pensions and Social Security programs will suffer because of a lack of people in the workforce, with examples like Japan already demonstrating this. Worse, if there is no improvement, the meta-analysis data suggests humanity could be heading towards a worldwide sperm count of 0 as early as 2045. This is why I believe that this issue needs to be taken seriously, which is why I am applying for this program, so I can conduct a study analyzing possible reasons behind the declining sperm count worldwide.","Currently, I plan on studying in the medical field during my years at university, with a special focus on endocrinology. I hypothesize that ""estrogenics,"" man-made molecules that mimic the estrogen hormone, are to blame for the declining sperm and testosterone amounts worldwide. In his book, Estrogeneration, Dr. Anthony Jay describes ten main types of Estrogenics. Of those ten, I'm interested in researching the effects of Atrazine, Triclosan & APEs (Estrogenics found in soap), BP & 4-MBC (Estrogenics found in sunscreen), Red No. 3 & Red No. 40 (red colored dyes in food), parabens, phthalates, BPA & its lesser-known alternative BPS, and EE2 (birth control estrogenic) on model organisms such as zebrafish. Keep in mind that many of these have been banned in places like the EU and China, but are still legal in the US. ","Every year, my middle school participates in an event called Science Olympiad. And each year, my school places third or second, always losing to the Ames, IA team. In my seventh-grade year, my team placed third. Even though we medaled, we were 68 entire points behind the winning team, Ames, and 32 points behind the second place team. That year, I medaled in events Meteorology and Disease Detectives, but I knew I had let both my team and myself down by not studying as much as I should have on my other two events. So, last school year, determined not to make the same mistake, I studied hard, spending 75+ hours in my four study events, and stayed up late to cram every last detail into my notes. For the Meteorology test event, I self-studied from a college-level course to further understand the daily weather systems. I inspired my 14 other teammates to work just as hard, being a good role model for new recruits on the team. In the end, it all paid off, with me winning first place in all four study events I participated in- Anatomy & Physiology, Meteorology, Green Generation, and Crave the Wave- winning 4 of my team's 6 gold medals. My team was a mere 11 points from first place, a massive improvement from the year before. In fact, the change was enough to knock Ames out of first, and into second place for the first time in 20+ years. This year, understanding the importance of communication, I have organized group chats and study spaces, and have been sending email updates over strategies and tools the team can utilize.

Between the feeling of achy teeth and the inability to eat anything crunchier than soft bread, my appointment with the orthodontist kept creeping unbearably closer.  I didnâ€™t quite understand that the 2 year journey I was about to embark on would give me so much more than straight teeth.

Growing up, I was always reluctant to smile in photos.  My smile felt gawky, incomplete, and crooked.  The dental care that was available to me gave me my smile.  I had this newfound confidence and joy: I smiled more.

The UNâ€™s goal of Good Health is designed to â€œensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.â€  However, when most people think about this they only see the goal of ending extreme poverty, child mortality, and the regulation of diseases.  I think it goes deeper.  Good health and well-being doesnâ€™t start and end with our physical health; mental health and emotional well-being have been sidelined for far too long.

People are able to fully enjoy their day-to-day lives, pursue their dreams, and connect with others when these personal needs are met.  We become better people who can positively impact others around us.  Something as simple as having a smile that fits together can make a huge difference in the way someone lives their life, and the people they can affect along the way.","Iâ€™ve always loved puzzles.  We were always doing some type of puzzle in my house: jigsaw with my mom, rubix cubes with my dad, or Sudoku with my sister.  These games fostered my curiosity in solving problems with logic, which to no surprise, pushed me to look into engineering as a potential career.

Some part of me was always drawn to being a doctor though.  I saw my mom diagnosing illnesses, paralleling us solving puzzles on the coffee table in our living room, and helping kids feel better.  That always made sense to me: helping people.  When I discovered biomedical engineering, it seemed like the perfect place for me.  It was an idyllic mix between sticking with my mathematical brain and engineering aspirations while quenching my thirst for the interpersonal relations the medical field provided.

The Center for Global Womenâ€™s Health Technologies caught my eye immediately for their dedication to improving womenâ€™s lives by addressing and working to fix the problems surrounding cervical and breast cancer.  I was engrossed by the research done within the center, especially in establishing low-cost methods of screening for breast and cervical cancer.  The mission of the Center for GWHT immaculately aligns with my own beliefs surrounding womenâ€™s healthcare and equity.  This year, I have the pleasure of serving as an ambassador for The Pad Project, an organization committed to menstrual equity and making sure that all women and menstruators across the globe have access to healthcare and feminine products.

My ultimate goal is to make a difference for women and improve their health conditions across the globe, and I firmly believe that the Center for GWHT can help me start that journey in a research setting.  The Ignite Maker Program is unlike anything Iâ€™ve ever seen before - and the opportunity it provides is unmatched.  The ambiguity of the program has allowed past Makers to develop such unique projects that have the potential to solve modern issues.  I want to be at the forefront of innovation and service that can help meet and exceed the basic needs of everyone.","Twenty.  

All I needed was twenty people.  

There have been 2 AP Physics classes in Wakefield history.  It became my mission to make that number 3.  After watching my sister have the class, AP Physics has been in my planned course since freshman year.  Taking physics solidified her interest in engineering and gave her some of the best friends in high school.  So, I started pitching early.

I had already convinced my friends who liked science to take it with me our junior year.  We sold the class to others on its principles of math and usefulness to college and career planning, yet so many turned us down.  Despite having aspiring engineers, doctors, and science teachers, everyone seemed to believe the class would be â€œtoo hardâ€ or â€œtoo much work.â€  I didnâ€™t understand their logic, but regardless, we continued to push, hoping we could at least scrape by with 20 people.

Eventually, course registration came along, and all of our work was put to the test.  I rattled off in my head who definitely signed up versus the maybes and how that would affect the numbers.  The weeks it took registration to end and for administration to set the classes dragged on.  Each day felt like a week, and each week a month.

Finally, our teachers were given their lists.  The bell rang, and I raced up two flights of stairs to our physics teacherâ€™s room.  Calves burning and slightly out of breath, I entered the room and caught her eye.  The huge grin on her face told me enough: it went through.

However, with the rising problem of light pollution, observations as such are harder to operate and organize; consequently, this makes it harder for me to be able to carry out my observations and potential experiments. As well as, the problem of light pollution results in disturbance to life clocks of a variety of species. This is why goal number 7 are very important to me. By combining these two goals together, I would like to work and develop my Ignite Makers project. ","Participation in this program last year has unleashed a plethora of opportunities; I am currently in the process of publishing my research in the Youth Science Journal. Mainly, my research interests center around the application of gene therapies in the aim of treating different disorders and diseases, as well as the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 

Having the opportunity to participate in programs as such helps me understand that having a potential career in science is possible; moreover, it helps reinstate the fact that science, specifically biology, biomedicine and biomedical sciences, are what I want to continue doing in life. 

In terms of career goals, I wish to finish my undergraduate studies (most likely biochemistry) in the UK and then apply (and hopefully get in) for a PhD in the United States. Along the way, I would like to have the opportunity to participate in many internships that will stimulate my love for science even more.

This October, along with my co-organisers, I am creating the first ever in Poland science event, which will occur during the International CRISPR Day, in order to provide a space for youth to connect and talk about their scientific interests. During the event, high school students will have the opportunity to present their scientific research in a form of a 15-minute long presentation.

Ever since I was young, I was always fascinated and fixated on the likes of porscheâ€™s, bugatti's, and other high end expensive racing cars. Later as I started learning about how these cars worked and ran on immense amounts of gasoline, and the effects that it had on the environment, it astounded me on how much natural resources were being used just to power these machines. When I saw my first EV, the Chevy Volt, my first question was â€œWhy donâ€™t all cars use this more sustainable form of energy?â€

Many believe that switching to a more sustainable form of energy for many products - not just EVâ€™s- will have other consequences such as economic and social costs. I disagree with these sentiments - I believe that using a more sustainable form of energy will benefit almost all of humanity in both the short and long term, and that with our current situation of global warming already yielding great tangible consequences: rising sea levels, higher global temperatures, and more wildfires than ever before, any change to a more sustainable and cleaner version of energy consumption will help us in all areas of society, economics included.

I believe that itâ€™s the responsibility of all of us to play our part, even if it seems insignificant, to not only take steps in the right direction in using cleaner energy, but also to innovate and adapt to our current problems, as humans have done time and time again throughout history with humanityâ€™s greatest obstacles. ","Iâ€™ve had a keen interest in Computer Science during my academic career, and I plan on continuing to pursue it as a major in college, and to conduct research within the field of Computer Science combined with other fields of science, engineering, or humanities.

I have always believed that Computer Science is an important subject not by itself, but it is most useful when combined with other areas of study that can help individuals in all aspects of their lives. One of those areas that I am interested in is within the Health and Biotechnology sectors, which have a huge potential for future exploration and research to help people using Computer Science. 

I am interested in working with the Center for Global Health Technologies as an Ignite maker because of my combined interest in research, helping others and my skills in Computer Science. An example where I used all three of these in concert was during my research project on Inexpensive Glasses for the Visually Impaired using AI and ML. I alongside a team helped design and build a prototype glasses that detected both text and objects and read them out loud to the user through auditory means such as headphones, which would allow them to be able to know what was in front of them or what text they were reading without having to use existing braille or having to reach out and touch the object. This helped increase both the safety and efficiency of people with Visual Impairments, who could now, with the help of software, be able to more accurately tell what objects are and read text. We also reached out to the American Federation of the Blind, who expressed interest in our project.

I am particularly drawn to the mission of the Center for Global Health Technologies, and my interest in working as an Ignite Maker is deeply rooted with the organizationâ€™s goals of harnessing technology to tackle health disparities. The potential to collaborate with experts from diverse fields and to be part of a community that actively seeks to develop solutions for global health challenges is an exciting prospect.","One of the most important learning experiences where I was able to exhibit both perseverance and teamwork was during my research project on Inexpensive Glasses for the Visually Impaired using AI and ML. During the process of installing libraries to allow the Raspberry Pi 3 to connect to the onboard camera we had connected, the camera was unable to be detected from the raspberry pi. 

While me and my teammates puzzled ourselves, trying to figure out where we had gone wrong, I proposed that it would be best if we had written down step by step the process of how we got there, and check if there had been any mistakes made. 

When this resulted in failure, we spent the next few weeks researching, reading articles online, and watching hours of YouTube videos trying to figure out how to make this one camera work. We almost decided to give up and buy a new camera off of Amazon when I noticed something: The version of the operating system installed on the raspberry pi on all the tutorials and articles was completely different from the version we had installed. None of the tutorials had noticed this, and I wouldnâ€™t have if I hadnâ€™t taken the time to read every command being spun out by the Terminal within the YouTube videos. 

In the end it was as simple as downgrading the version of the OS installed on the raspberry pi, and we were able to continue with the rest of our project, coding switches, adding in Machine Learning libraries, and ensuring that we documented our processes along the way to ensure that we didn't make the mistake of overlooking things again.",Y,Mehdi Hussain,Male,pre,Maker,Evaluating because it allows communities to share feedback and needs that the prototype has  to take into account in the future,All of the above are viable solutions to the new need,Listen to the community,Listen,"Focus on community goals because goals, like problems, require attention and effort","Feasibility- will it be an affordable option for people?,Desirability- does the design solve a problem?,Viable- is it a short or long-term solution for the problem?",Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,80,70,90,100,80,90,100,90,80,"I've had prior experience in conducting engineering design projects, and through the engineering-design process.",100,70,100,90,90,100,100,100,90,,0,20,0,0,10,10,20,0,30,,Mehdi Hussain,Male,post,Maker,,,,"Defining because it pushes the implementer to constantly think about unresolved needs 	in a community,Brainstorming because it always allows new ideas of improving a prototype to surface,Evaluating because it allows communities to share feedback and needs that the prototype has  to take into account in the future,Creating because the implementer can think of how to make the prototype more appealing",All of the above are viable solutions to the new need,Listen to the community,Define,"Focus on community goals because goals, like problems, require attention and effort","Desirability- does the design solve a problem?,Viable- is it a short or long-term solution for the problem?",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,,100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,,0,20,30,10,20,10,20,20,20,,Through a friend (not rithin),"Being able to learn about the Human-Centered Design allowed both me and my partner to explore solutions to problems not only on a global scale, but those within our communities as well.",Iterating over multiple iterations in order to choose the best possible design and come up with a better design each time. ,"Yes, the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Global Health still remains important to me as it is something that affects the lives of everyone across the world.

Due to the heavy utilization of energy in today's world, transitioning to clean energy would be pivotal in combating numerous environmental concerns. Unfortunately, fossil fuels have and continue to dominate the energy industry, inevitably fueling the climate change crisis. Not only are fossil fuels detrimental to the environment, but they are also a finite resource that will eventually run out. Luckily, clean energy resources are renewable and infinite, so utilizing these resources would be extremely beneficial for the long term health of the planet. Early this summer, I travelled to Sweden to stay with my cousin for one month. One of the most striking attributes of Sweden that continues to interest me today is how sustainable and clean the country is. Wind turbines could be seen in nearly every town, utilizing the heavy wind conditions on and off shore. I also saw a hydropower plant, to which I soon learned hydropower accounts for 45% of Swedenâ€™s electricity power. Seeing these changes firsthand opened my eyes of how great renewable energy is and how important it is to be implemented globally.","I am deeply passionate about studying sustainability and the environment and have a strong desire to contribute to addressing the pressing environmental challenges we face today. My college and career goals revolve around acquiring the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to make a meaningful impact in this field. Recently, I have truly opened my options of my career goals and want to pursue opportunities that will help me decide what I want to study. I do know  I want to understand the interconnectedness of ecological systems, human activities, and social issues. Through coursework, research projects, and practical experiences, I hope to develop a solid foundation in environmental science, sustainable practices, and resource management. I do intend to open my goals into the business and entrepreneurship field as well. Most likely related to sustainability and the environment. This has been a huge interest of mine and creating a brand or product that would promote sustainability is a thought I cannot let go of. I am interested in working with the Center for Global Health Technologies as an Ignite Maker because I aspire to collaborate with organizations and communities that can help me learn and grow. I hope to learn and expand my knowledge of how I can develop and implement sustainable solutions that mitigate climate change, preserve biodiversity, and promote social equity. Overall, my college and career goals reflect my commitment to building a more sustainable and resilient future. ","This year, my Aerospace and Engineering club  encountered a challenging situation where we discovered our NASA Techrise project was destroyed in an explosion. It was a difficult setback that could have discouraged us, but instead, it became an opportunity for us to showcase our teamwork and ambition. I remember the scene so vividly where we were all watching the livestream of the rocket launching into the air with our craft inside. We stared in awe and excitement, but short after takeoff the rocket sparked into flames, eventually exploding in the air in a sudden burst. Once it finally hit us what happened, we felt devastated and disheartened. It was months of hard work that was suddenly taken from us at an instant. However, rather than dwelling on our disappointment, we came together as a team to find a solution. I organized a meeting to discuss the situation and brainstorm ideas on how to move forward. I tried my best supporting and encouraging the club offering words of reassurance and motivation. I recognized that collective effort was crucial in overcoming this setback, and set aside any personal frustrations. Next, we planned out ways to devise a plan to rebuild our project. Each team member took on specific tasks according to their strengths and abilities. I divided the workload efficiently, ensuring that everyone had a clear focus and understood their responsibilities. This division of labor not only helped us work more effectively but also fostered a sense of unity and collaboration. Despite these ambitions, it became clear we were unable to rebuild our craft due to the lack of resources and funding. It was another setback that was disappointing and devastating. However, I believe we did not let the setback define us or deter us from our goals. Instead, we remained determined and resilient. Even when faced with challenges and obstacles, we stayed committed to finding a solution and fixing our project to the best of our abilities.

","Originally, I was looking at sustainability research projects being completed at Duke. I wanted to reach out to the people involved if there were any volunteer opportunities for myself to contribute. In doing so, I came across Ignite on the GWHT page on Duke.  ",The most rewarding program for me was presenting it. Being able to share what I have been working on with my own voice and slides was incredibly rewarding as I could reveal my passion for the environment and sustainability. I felt accomplished as I could share my ideas with like minded people. ,"The most difficult part of the program was the short time frame for the actual build component. Researching and meeting through Zoom was helpful, but I did feel as if it simplified the way I viewed my project too much. When it came to building, I realized I should have researched more about circuitry as it was a big component of my project. Being hands on was the most helpful to me, especially overcoming obstacles. ","Yes, the UN Sustainable Development Goal is still important, if not more important than it was before the program. Seeing the multitude of opportunities that open up when getting involved is incredible to experience. I enjoy being surrounded by people who are just as passionate about the environment as me.

I looked into the environmental science research projects going on at Duke and became fascinated with how involved students were getting. It definitely further sparked my interests for the environment even more than before. ","I would change the proportion of time between research and the actual build term. Having sufficient time to build and become hands on with your project is very important for its success, therefore I would slightly shorten the research term and add it to the building term.

225,Nachammai Annamalai,Nachammai,Annamalai,She/her/hers,15,Junior/11th,Asian,South Iredell High School,"Mooresville, North Carolina, USA",28117,GWHT website,Computer Science and Engineering,4,Ignite Makers,Clean Water,"The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 6, dedicated to ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, resonates deeply with me, given our current global climate and escalating needs. Clean water is more than a resource â€“ it's a lifeline that connects us all, a vital element that sustains our existence. That's why I'm deeply drawn to UN Sustainable Development Goal 6, which focuses on making sure everyone has access to clean water and sanitation. I believe this goal is the key to building healthier communities and a better world for everyone.
Growing up, I've come to realize that almost everyone does not have easy access to clean water. My journey has been instrumental in shaping my perspective on this pressing issue. I was born and raised in India for a few years, a nation where the specter of water scarcity looms large. Life amidst the densely populated slums and overcrowded housing complexes underscored the stark reality of limited access to potable water. This experience etched in me a profound understanding of the privilege that clean water represents. This is a privilege that many of us take for granted, even today, knowing that the amount of accessible potable water is decreasing. After coming here, I've been fortunate to grow up in a community where clean water is easily accessible. However, it often troubles me to think that there are individuals, families, and entire communities who are still struggling to find safe drinking water.
Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of where they live, has safe and clean water to drink. The world seems unthinkable at the moment, as developing nations around the world are constantly suffering to get proper water for drinking, hygiene, and hospital processes. Lack of clean water affects not only physical health but also education and economic opportunities. It's a cycle that traps communities in a cycle of poverty and prevents them from reaching their full potential. Thus, the UN SDG 6 of â€œClean Waterâ€ for me, is not just a goal on paper â€“ it's a mission that speaks to my heart. I believe that by working together and using the engineering process, we can turn this mission into a reality. Joining the Duke Ignite Makers Program would give me the chance to contribute to something meaningful, to make a difference in the lives of people who lack access to clean water.","As of now, I am interested in the intersection of computer science, research, and technology to share my ideas with the world. With skills from multidisciplinary fields, I hope to eventually aid in technological advancements and instill innovative ideas to impact local and global communities. In the future, I aspire to pursue a career that will have a positive impact on my near surroundings as well as my extended community. I want to use the knowledge I have learned in the fields of Ai, cybersecurity, modeling, and math to impact the world around me and help improve healthcare conditions. 
Thus, possible majors would be computer science, data science, engineering, or topics from similar computational disciplines. I hope to obtain my undergraduate degree from Duke University, NC State, Chapel Hill, or Georgia Tech. Past research categories of interest include biotechnology, particle physics, water sustainability mechanisms, iron deficiency, and breast cancer. Researching issues that arise in these various fields has given me a different and unique perspective. A common thread that ties these topics together is my unwavering desire to employ engineering methods in seeking solutions, highlighting their interconnectedness. Looking forward, I aspire to delve into further topics, crafting cost-effective solutions that cater to a broad and diverse audience.
The Duke Ignite Makers Program presents a unique opportunity for me to contribute meaningfully to a cause that I am so ardently passionate about. As someone inherently fascinated by the intricate mechanics of the world around me, I was inspired to apply these principles to the water crisis, one of the most urgent trials of our time. Therefore, participating in this program would offer an avenue for me to leverage my skills and insights to make a tangible difference in the lives of those bereft of clean water access. The prospect of learning, collaborating with like-minded peers, and innovating, all while positively impacting the world through the water pathway, fills me with an unparalleled sense of excitement and purpose. Additionally, I would get to immerse myself in interests that I harbor but have never explored, learning to use an engineering mindset to assess issues to solve them properly. More importantly, I would gain insight into designing a solution for a globalized issue, creating physical prototypes, and testing them. It is this opportunity to effect change and drive progress toward achieving UN SDG 6 that motivates me to become a part of this prestigious program at Duke University.","Engaging in the New York Academy of Sciences Junior Academy presented an intricate challenge that required my team and I to employ astute teamwork and unyielding perseverance to continue working smoothly. At the outset, all participants were tasked with forming teams, spanning across geographical boundaries to foster a sense of global collaboration.  After forming our team, we chose our category â€“ water sustainability. Even though our project took off smoothly at the start, we started encountering issues each week and had to think innovatively to surpass obstacles and continue working. 
We found that running a diverse coalition spanning distinct time zones and different grades was difficult, but our six-member cohort all shared the same commitment to tackling water sustainability. As we embarked on our project, ""Water Sustainability in Tropical Regions,"" we knew we would have to work hard â€“ all virtually â€“ to address and pose a solution to the complex issue.
Coordinating across different time zones wasn't easy, but we found ways to make it work. We scheduled virtual meetings to bridge the gap and make sure everyone could contribute their ideas. This showed how determined we were to hear each other out and work together despite the time differences. Our determination also showed when we tried to find a mentor. We searched tirelessly, using communication and networking skills to connect with someone who could guide us. This demonstrated our persistence in seeking guidance and not giving up easily. However, we faced a challenge when one team member didn't contribute as much. Instead of letting it bring us down, we stepped up to fill the gaps and support each other. This experience highlighted our ability to adapt and keep moving forward, even when things don't go as planned.
Looking back, our journey through the Junior Academy underscored the power of teamwork and persistence. We learned to coordinate across time zones, adapt to challenges, and never give up on our goals. All of our teamwork efforts along with each individualâ€™s hard work ultimately led us to victory, as we placed first out of 108 teams globally. Even today, I can proudly say that I wouldnâ€™t have won without the contributions and perseverance from my teammates. These invaluable lessons have indelibly shaped my perception of collaboration and determination, virtues I am eager to carry forward as I pursue my academic voyage.

Enloe Highschool,"Cary, North Carolina, United States",27519,GWHT website,Biomedical Engineering,4,Ignite Makers,Good Health,"Following my grandmotherâ€™s instructions, I carefully plucked the stems from the ground before returning to the kitchen to prepare the age-old remedy. After boiling water and spending hours grinding the roots, I had created the perfect cure for a common cold. In Vijayawada, turmeric was the answer to almost any illness. And not a day went by without me bringing my grandmother a plate full of it to help ease her aching legs. As I rubbed a handful on her ankles, she would tell me stories of the countless women in our village who died during childbirth. It was a painful reality, one that was all too common in Vijayawada and even 8,000 miles west in the United States. Growing up, I witnessed the women in my life navigate their health struggles, often battling stigma and a lack of access to adequate care. It wasn't until I faced my own crisis that the truth of these disparities hit me with a force that was impossible to ignore. Months went by without the familiar rhythm of my menstrual cycle, and as I stared at the calendar in dread, I knew something was wrong. It was in that moment of vulnerability that I found my own voice, a voice that echoed the stories of the women in my grandmother's tales. My own experience was a stark reminder that women's health issues are not just distant narratives; they are a reality that can strike close to home. This journey led me to the heart of the UN Goal of Good Health and Well-Being. To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages became more than an ideal; it became a personal mission. However, it was Goal 5, ""Gender Equality,"" that became the powerful catalyst, the driving force behind my journey, intertwining with the threads of my ambition to make a difference. Just as turmeric had been the age-old remedy for countless ailments, I recognized that knowledge and empowerment could be the remedy for the silent struggles of women's health.","It's hard to become a woman, but it's even harder with shame and secrecy surrounding it. In this generational cycle, the potential for success surrenders to societal stigma. I want to end this cycle, and asking â€˜whyâ€™ is the first step, but education allows me to delve deeper and do something meaningful with that question. In conjunction with my passion for womenâ€™s health and education lies my interest in bioengineering, best summed up by Theodore von Karmanâ€™s quote, ""Scientists study the world as it is, engineers create the world that never has been"". It is because of this that I want to pursue a career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on women's health. My ultimate goal is to become a professor in this field and work towards building equitable engineering solutions that are low-cost, innovative, and empowering for all. Through teaching about reproductive health, I hope to break the taboo and address the disparities around womenâ€™s healthcare through the lens of inclusion and opportunity.

Being an Ignite Maker will allow me to do exactly this. With maternal mortality rates rising exponentially, Iâ€™d like to engineer a low-cost and accessible device that aids birthing people in detecting complications like preeclampsia and eclampsia early on to improve maternal health outcomes and give them the tools they need to take control of their own health. This program would be my first step into the realm of engineering and will be the foundation for my future aspirations. Through the mentoring that CGHT provides and the flexibility to explore my interests, Iâ€™d have the resources and support to transition my idea into action. With the help of the Center for Global Health Technologies, Iâ€™ll have the opportunity to pursue the intersection between two fieldsâ€”health and technology. Most importantly, being an Ignite Maker, much like science, is not something that is experienced alone. Rather, itâ€™s because of the community, faculty, and ideas that I want to be a part of this program and because of the plethora of potential that I await.","The music, the camaraderie, and the shared passion. This was my solace. As I made my way up the winding asphalt road that led to Winston-Salem's football stadium, each tiny ridge felt like a brutal attack on our old and rusted instruments. Our underfunded music department strained our resources, and challenges seemed to crescendo alongside our ambitions. However, just as we were about to enter the stadium, a loud sound shattered the tense ambiance; our marimba had collapsed. Panic surged through the ensemble like an electric shock. Five minutes was all we had, and I was the only one in our group who knew how to rebuild this instrument.
 
In the ensuing minutes, I realized that despite the many setbacks weâ€™ve faced, we faced them as a group, as a team, and as a family. Thus, one truth is certain: no one ever gives up on family. I knew I had to do something, so I picked up a piece and looked at my friend on the right, signaling that we had to work together. I delegated tasks to each member based on their strengths. Victor was good at lifting weights, so he held up the resonators. Margaret, a master of arranging, placed the keys in the correct slots, and slowly, like a chain reaction, we all fell into our roles instinctively to rebuild the instrument. As we stood before the roaring crowd, the marimba now reassembled, I felt the rhythm of our shared heartbeat. Every band member, representing a different component of the instrument, played their part with meticulous dedication. It was as if life had orchestrated a poignant analogy before us: the marimba could not produce its enchanting melody without each bar, each resonator, and each mallet working in unison. Our marimba's collapse mirrored the fragility of our band's foundation, showing that just like any team, we were interdependent. A lone mallet cannot create harmony; a single musician could not create a symphony. Our performance, despite the initial setback, was the best set we've ever played, and it could not have been done without all of us.",Y,Niharika Koppolu,Female,pre,Maker,Evaluating because it allows communities to share feedback and needs that the prototype has  to take into account in the future,All of the above are viable solutions to the new need,Listen to the community,Define,"Focus on community goals because goals, like problems, require attention and effort","Feasibility- will it be an affordable option for people?,Desirability- does the design solve a problem?,Viable- is it a short or long-term solution for the problem?",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,60,100,100,80,100,60,100,100,100,"I'd say that I'm pretty confident about my skills in research and the science/scientific side of this process.

208,Noreen Majeed,Noreen,Majeed,She/her/hers,14,Sophomore/10th,Asian,Raleigh Charter High School,"Cary, North Carolina, United States of America",27519,previous Ignite participant,Pre-medicine ,4,Ignite Entrepreneurs,Good Health,"United Nations created a list of Sustainable Development Goals as a framework for tackling challenges worldwide and helping improve quality of life. To me, the goal that stands out amongst these is good health thanks to its impact on individual health, societal progress, and exemplifying human potential.

First off, good health is important to me personally as I find it is directly tied to good quality of life and builds my happiness, aspirations, and goals. When I am truly healthy, I can live my life fully pursuing my interests and passions, allowing for personal growth. Achieving good health allows me to seize opportunities that matter to me and make the best out of my life, nurturing new relationships, facing challenges with strength, and overall living a more productive and fulfilling life.

Next, achieving this goal would push us closer to a society filled with progress. Social and economic progress is tied hand in hand with the advancement of a nation thanks to a healthy population. Health individuals means more productive members in society and the workforce pushing along developmental and economic growth. Furthermore, good health promotes the younger generation to prosper by encouraging education filled with productive, motivated children. All in all, societies with healthier individuals are more progressed with less poverty, increased stability, and unity.

 Additionally, I believe good health empowers each and every individual to reach their full potential. Things like illness or medical restrictions can limit innovation, creativity, and productivity decreasing human progress. Thanks to a multitude of healthcare systems in place, prevention, and safety measures we are able to create a thriving, healthier environment for all. The vision for this brighter future pushes me to provide a better life for all through good health. A more equitable and prosperous world starts with individuals who maximize their capabilities and contribute to society thanks to good health.

In conclusion, the UN Goal of Good Health deeply resonates with my core beliefs thanks to the impact it has on all areas of society. It ensures the well-being of myself and everyone around me along with allowing for the growth of humanity. By prioritizing and working towards this goal, we can foster a world filled with individuals making collective contributions towards the betterment of society.
","My college and career goals revolve around my passion for medicine. From a young age, I have been captivated by the human body and the positive change healthcare workers can have on the well-being of an individual's life. Pursuing healthcare is not only a personal dream but rather about my commitment to making a positive difference on people's lives to give back to my community. Through college, I want to pursue a rigorous course in pre-medicine to expand my knowledge of this expansive field in a multitude of ways such as research opportunities, training, and leadership opportunities. Career wise, I would like to be a skilled and empathetic physician either majoring in dermatology or surgery. No matter what I do, I am committed to helping others through their suffering, promoting their well-being, and providing the best healthcare I can. With my lasting commitment to medicine throughout college and my career, I aim to improve healthcare on a local and global scale to make a lasting impact on the well-being of individuals and communities.

My research interests are deeply rooted in healthcare and pursuing unique solutions to help others. I am committed to helping people improve their lives by exploring areas that have a positive impact on healthcare. Through research, I aim to uncover knowledge, develop new ideas, and contribute to the global advancement of healthcare. From discovering new treatments, creating healthcare programs, writing a research paper, I am fueled by a desire to understand healthcare challenges and combat them with innovative solutions. My research efforts are filled with empathy, a passion for contribution to society, and a desire to make healthcare more equitable, accessible, and to a higher standard than the present.

Lastly, I am deeply interested in working with the Center for Global Health Technologies as an Ignite Maker thanks to my passion for utilizing technology and innovation to address healthcare challenges. The Center's focus on taking the power of resources and technology to create a solution to improve healthcare aligns perfectly with my values and core beliefs. As an IGNITE Maker, I am able to collaborate with other like-minded individuals who share the same passion for creating positive change allowing us to boost each other's innovation. This unique environment would allow me to utilize my skills to provide the underserved population's healthcare challenges that so desperately need to be addressed. The prospect of helping the Center by creating sustainable and scalable technologies deeply draws me in as having a lasting impact on global health deeply excites me along with the chance to be able to collaborate with like-minded individuals. 
","Becoming a finalist in the McIntyre Youth Leadership Challenge is a testament to oneâ€™s qualities as a leader. This accomplishment thrives on the pillars of teamwork and perseverance to allow for personal growth. As a finalist in this program, I was able to experience first hand the power of collaboration and determination to push me towards success.

First off, I had the privilege of working with many talented individuals from teachers to counselors to psychologists. Together, we worked together to come up with a collaborative solution that served everyone. I made sure to foster an environment of trust, creativity, respect, and innovation as each team members strength helped contribute to the challenges that arose. As they always say, â€œthe more the merrierâ€, and in this case, the more help I had the better the product than anything I could have created on my own.

However, my journey to becoming a finalist was not easy. We faced many setbacks, challenges, and our own limitations. However, I made sure to push through with the strength and passion I had for the cause of teen mental health. A resilient mindset helped me face failures such as regulation in schools as an opportunity to grow rather than a setback. I learned how to rise against adversity and move forward along with the power of sheer determination. 
Beyond this, I was able to grow personally along with expanding my leadership skills. This challenge was a journey where I developed my communication, empathy, and teamwork skills along with the importance of listening to everyone around me and figuring out a solution that addressed the communities needs. Beyond this, my perseverance helped me overcome self-doubt and gain a new growth mindset towards life in general. 

All in all, becoming a finalist in the McIntyre Youth Leadershop Challenge was a challenge but in the end, I was able to create a prototype for how to address poor teen mental health in schools. The teamwork, perserverance, and true passion I experienced was like none other and helped me step forward through the development of many vital life skills, helping guide me on my journey to being an exceptional leader.

215,Rithinteja Aechan,Rithinteja,Aechan,he/him/his,17,Senior/12th,Asian,Green Level High,Cary,27519,GWHT website,Computer Science/Biomedical Engineering,4,Ignite Makers,Good Health,"The UN Sustainable Development Goal focused on ensuring good health and well-being has gradually grown within me as over time I've learnt about how health disparities affect lives firsthand, making this goal a personal mission.

An example of inequality that I have observed when it comes to healthcare are in terms of disparity in terms of race. Visiting the doctor's office, I noticed multiple times that the nurse had difficulty finding veins in my arm. This would lead to nurses having to insert a needle twice to collect blood because of a darker skin complexion. Over the course of a few years, I have begun to learn more and more about inequalities regarding health and medicine. During a summer program, a professor of Biomedical Engineering, Dr. Aaron Kyle, explained how the death rate for black mothers was 2.6 times higher than white mothers, and how the mortality rate for black men was higher than other races. These problems opened to me how racial disparities in terms of healthcare are common and a serious issue. Although my problem wasnâ€™t as serious compared to what Dr. Aaron Kyle had described for others, it allowed me to understand that in terms of healthcare, there are imbalances in achieving this goal. 
 
Another example I have observed is that access to life changing medical technology in economically developing countries is limited due to the cost of those technologies. An example is a pair of AI glasses for the visually impaired that are in the range of $3000-5000. These glasses are practically impossible for economically developing countries and for many people to attain. From this problem, with a team I was able to devise a pair of inexpensive AI glasses by collaborating with the National Federation of Blind and create a working pair for $100. From this experience I had learned that I could be able to create technologies that would be inexpensive and could help people in economically developing countries. 

In conclusion, the UN's goal of good health resonates deeply due to personal experiences highlighting healthcare disparities. As I grow up, I am aiming to help bridge these disparities to help create affordable technologies that are able to address this goal. 
","I see engineering being an important part of my future education and career goals as a way for me to advance my skills and knowledge in college and then be able to get a job in software engineering or biomedical engineering to help people. The reason this is my career goal is that I find it interesting to find a problem that people have and be able to make solutions to that problem. In the past, I have done projects that align with my career goal of being able to help people. An example of such is a sign language glove that translates sign language into audible output. In my project, I worked with a friend to create a reliable and affordable glove that people who have audible impairments can easily communicate with people who donâ€™t know sign language. This project sparked my interest in being able to create solutions for people to help them with their day-to-day lives. Overall, in the future, I would like to be able to work in a career where I enjoy designing innovative solutions for problems that people face on a day-to-day basis as it is something interesting and fun to do.
 
This program will help me develop as a person as it allows me to have a deeper dive into the human centered design process compared to personal projects or working alone.  The Ignite Makers program encourages projects to be human centered to create solutions directed for people to address the right problems and goals. Additionally, working with faculty from the Center for Global Health technologies and students from Duke who have experience in the engineering world will allow me to further increase my technical and communication skills for real world practice and education. Additionally, what makes this program unique is that it involves working on real-world problems, which helps develop a sense of social responsibility and the ability to make a positive impact on society. Overall, this program would be able to give me the tools and knowledge in my career to excel and have a more positive impact on the world and society through different inventions and ideas. In conclusion, I would like the opportunity to work for the global health technologies program as it is deeply aligned with my future goals as GWHT focuses on making technology that are people centered and able to serve the community through different inventions and ideas. 
","During my sophomore summer I attended a STEM program called Summer Ventures with NCSSM. In summer ventures, I worked with Physics professors, Dr. Sprague and Dr. Kenney, from East Carolina University regarding a personal research project where I investigated the efficacy of blue light-blocking glasses.  During my experiment there were many times in which our spectrometer was not matching the intended calibration settings. I became frustrated with the process as it was taking several days for the program to work and wanted to give up and try for another project. During that time I began to help one of my classmates with his code as he had problems with his graphs from the Arduino showing up. After I helped him solve his problem with his project, he helped me go through the steps to correctly setup the machine so it would work for my experiment. Surprisingly he had found different solutions to make the spectrometer work. In the end, I was able to finish my research project on time through perseverance and with the help of my classmate. 

During my experience with my research project,  I had to restart my experiment many times and through that experience, I learned that research is not something that would always go smoothly the first time. This experience taught me that in any field of research, you would need to keep repeating the process over and over again until it would work and that failure is part of the process. I also learnt that you can not do any project or research by yourselves as you will need from other people to show you different perspectives to a problem and solution to help you achieve your goal.

212,Riya Shah,Riya,Shah,She/her/hers,16,Senior/12th,Asian,Enloe High School,"Cary, NC, USA",27519,previous Ignite participant,"Biology, Public Health",4,Ignite Makers,Good Health,"The UN Sustainable Development goal of Good Health simply states that well-being should be promoted and ensured for all ages. Many of our existing healthcare infrastructures collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving vulnerable populations unsupported. 

According to the CDC, 1 in 13 American adults suffer from Long Covid. 79% of these adults are severely limited in their daily lives, with symptoms ranging from fatigue to severe neurological failure.  I have been passionate about neurology and biotechnology ever since my father was diagnosed with Long Covid and dysautonomia- failure of the autonomic nervous system. After researching his illness, I realized that my father was part of the millions of Americans struggling with a mass disabling event, that suspended the lives of several families and removed up to 4 million workers from their jobs, compounding to up to $230 billion dollars of lost earnings. 

Many of the problems I have facedâ€”having limited resources as a teenager with a disabled parent, scarcity of specialized healthcare centers, and the struggle to understand the consequences of experimental drugsâ€”are hallmarks of deeper systemic inequities that can disproportionately affect marginalized groups. I hope to create solutions to provide support for those with an often-overlooked illness, and for teenagers with disabled family members, like myself. While Iâ€™ve faced adversity, Iâ€™m grateful for the support I had and aspire to help those with less access. My first hand experience offers me a valuable perspective that I can leverage to create changes in holistic healthcare delivery that Iâ€™m passionate about. 

My vision of healthcare aligns with the goals of Good Health. The UN addresses the needs of the disadvantaged groups that may be unable to advocate for their own wellbeing. Furthermore, this SDG goal uses numerical metrics and extensive data collection to address the needs of vulnerable groups in a specific and targeted manner in order to maximize impact. 

Iâ€™m extremely invested in these topics because I believe that everybody deserves to feel safe and secure regardless of their physical state or socio-economic capability.  I want to research and address how policymakers, research organizations, and existing safety nets can collaborate for better outcomes in often-neglected areas of healthcare. 
","This spring, I had the opportunity to witness the creations of previous Ignite Makers during presentation day at the Duke Fitzpatrick building, and was amazed by what I saw. The Ignite program combined makers from all over the world and encouraged them to hone their skills and create solutions to the problems they were passionate about. From menstrual awareness to knee arthritis, every Maker had a story and a drive that they harnessed into community impact. It was not only the opportunity to learn new skills and network with a diverse group of peers that attracted me to this program, but also the ample resources each Maker was given, from state of the art materials to professional help from the most seasoned experts in their fields to advance their drive for bioengineering. Many of the health issues facing our society today require multidisciplinary collaboration, and the center for Global Health technologies offers an amazing platform to gain and exchange knowledge in various fields. 

I believe that I would be a good fit for the IGNITE program because I love to turn my observations into action. After one of my family friends was struggling with her mental health and body image as she underwent chemotherapy, I wanted to express my support. First, I used online surveys to interview hundreds of chemo survivors on the self-care items they enjoyed most. Then, I assembled my first care bag, filled with chemo-approved self-care items- Lemonheads to alleviate nausea, socks for cold hospital floors, chapstick for dried lips, scarves, journals, and more. This initiative transformed into my registered nonprofit, Sunshine in my Bag, where Iâ€™ve distributed hundreds of care packages and raised thousands for this cause. Iâ€™ve continued using problem-solving methods to create a resilient businessâ€” for example, during the pandemic, I was able to retain donations by using online platforms such as my website and social media, allowing me to provide support when many chemotherapy patients needed it the most. 

In the future, I want to extend my problem-solving nature into studying health equity. Iâ€™m inspired to combine my firsthand experience with a disabled family member as well as my volunteer work to help people with various neurological conditions, including the cognitive decline associated with chemotherapy. I want to use scientific research skills to solve the root causes of these illnesses. Developing treatments for chronic illnesses can not only improve millions of lives and strengthen the American workforce and economy, it is the key to an equitable future. Many underprivileged groups struggle with access to safe and affordable healthcare, and developing new technologies that can be FDA approved and more easily accessible can mitigate these discrepancies. I believe healthcare is a human right and dream of a day where everyone can access care, and the IGNITE program will provide me with the skills that will allow me to turn these dreams into reality. 
","â€œIndian hair is stinky and weird,â€ the 8-year-old said, nonchalantly walking away. I had just gotten my dream job: the Bank of America Student Leaders Internship. Student Leaders were paired with local nonprofits. I was fortunate to work at Power Scholars, an equitable YMCA summer program designed to help students at Title 1 schools with significant reading deficits. My job entailed everything from lunch duty to prepping lesson materials, and that day, a girl was trying to braid my hair when she made distasteful comments about my ethnicity. I was discouraged and shocked to see the innocent way many kids made these exclusionary statements, despite never meeting someone of my background. 

I was disheartened, but not defeated. I wanted to make sure that future students in the program felt safe to share their cultures without fearing judgment. The first thing I did was gather data from teachers to identify the problem at hand. They shared that post-COVID, many students, especially those from low-income or at-risk households, struggled with socio-emotional learning, and were uneducated about multicultural backgrounds. Then, I consulted with an education expert to identify the CASEL social-emotional learning standards as a framework. During the design process, I combined my own artistic passions with my lived experiences to come up with a solution- a multicultural read aloud lesson, and an art activity to help the students compare and contrast their unique backgrounds. Afterwards, I shared my work with my fellow interns, and we were all able to use our talents to create a holistic curriculum, with 5 lessons to address each CASEL standard. 

Lastly, it was time to test my solution. I struggled finding a teacher willing to give me a chance and was rejected by many, but all it took was one yes. My stomach flipped as I peered over a crowd of eager kids. What if they didnâ€™t like the book? However, throughout the course of my lesson, kids were able to find similarities with the book protagonists, and even said they were excited to try new foods and travel to new places. Afterwards, the lead teacher congratulated me, and said my lesson would be integrated into the curriculum for years to come. 

Through my internship, Iâ€™ve learned that the scientific method is incredibly versatile, and that I can have incredible impact through teamwork and perseverance. Itâ€™s important to observe communities to develop effective solutions, consult with experts, and most of all, have the courage to share your passions with others.

This is of interest to me because, while I am excited about all the new technologies, businesses, and different ways of transportation, there is a negative consequence we have to think about with these luxuries because they will be exhaustible. I feel it is important to think about not only the availability of energy/resources for the future generations, but to also take into account the disparities of energy poverty around the world. For instance, why canâ€™t we use the millions of pounds of food waste and/or agricultural by-products for energy and to provide clean energy to countries who are less fortunate than America?  Finding different sustainable energy opportunities will be a benefit to us currently (e.g., we donâ€™t need to get any hotter with our climate) and for generations to come.

Therefore, my goal is to attend a four-year university (Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill or NC State) and major in engineering and/or applied mathematics. I would also like to take time to study abroad and learn more about different countriesâ€™ needs and their use of energy.  Furthermore, my current career goal is to possibly work for an energy firm or start my own business that fuels my interest in science, technology, math, and engineeringâ€”while also serving to help people globally. 
I am interested in working with the Center for Global Health Technologies as an Ignite Maker because of its renowned global program and its mission to help students like myself create new and improved engineering solutions for my local community. I feel the CBHT through Ignite will continue to develop me as a critical thinker and problem solver as I set out on my career journey. ","I completed many projects in my life but one that I took pride in was building a roller coaster out of paper in my Physics class. It took a month to fully complete the roller coaster in the form of a drop tower and using a marble as the coaster cart. The requirements had to be about a meter and a half tall with loops, curves, turns, and many other complex attractions â€“ but the roller coaster had to made from paper. It didnâ€™t come without challenges.  A problem that plagues me even to this day is my overly sweaty hands. I have Hyperhidrosis.  If you are unfamiliar with this diagnosis medically, it is abnormally excessive sweating involving my extremities (particularly my hands and feet) that is unrelated to body temperature and exercise. For a visual understanding, imagine sitting without socks and looking down to find your feet in a puddle of water, or taking a test and there are tears and wet spots where answers should be. Thatâ€™s me. Since the roller coaster was made of paper, my hands would cause the paper to be so wet and limp that the tower would be unstable for the marble coaster; it constantly fell apart. There were many times I had to re-fold and find thicker paper to proceed with the building process. I was frustrated but realized that the frustration was not going to get the project done. I just embraced the sweat. I accepted my vulnerability and sucked up my pride. Luckily, the project could be teamwork based. I asked my teammates for their assistance and if it was okay for me to work more on the design process rather than the more hands-on aspects: they obliged. Overall, I felt happy that I could lead and help without having my medical condition get in the way.  This experience helped me realize that there is always more than one solution to most of our problems.

This goal resonates deeply with me due to its encompassing impact on human lives, societies, and the overall global progress. The pursuit of good health goes beyond mere absence of disease; it signifies the realization of physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

First and foremost, the goal of good health directly aligns with the intrinsic value of human life. Access to quality healthcare, nutrition, clean water, sanitation, and essential medical services are not only basic human rights but also prerequisites for individuals to lead meaningful and productive lives. When people are healthy, they can actively participate in their communities, pursue education and employment opportunities, and contribute positively to society.

Moreover, the health of individuals is closely intertwined with broader societal and economic development. A healthy population is more likely to be economically productive, which in turn leads to the growth of nations and the reduction of poverty. When communities have access to adequate healthcare, maternal and child mortality rates decline, ensuring that families are more stable and resilient. This, in turn, contributes to the achievement of other sustainable development goals, such as quality education, gender equality, and poverty eradication.

The importance of good health becomes even more evident in the face of global challenges, such as pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of healthcare systems and the urgent need for global collaboration in ensuring preparedness, response, and recovery. The health goal serves as a reminder that investment in resilient health systems and universal healthcare coverage is crucial not only for addressing current health crises but also for preventing and mitigating future ones.

Furthermore, the pursuit of good health extends beyond physical well-being. Mental health, often overlooked in the past, has gained prominence as an integral aspect of overall well-being. The inclusion of mental health in the SDGs signifies a progressive shift towards recognizing the importance of holistic health. By addressing mental health challenges, societies can reduce stigma, promote inclusivity, and foster environments where everyone feels valued and supported.

In conclusion, the UN Sustainable Development Goal of good health and well-being is important to me because it embodies the essence of a just and equitable world. It signifies our collective commitment to ensuring that every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances, has the opportunity to lead a healthy and fulfilling life. By prioritizing this goal, we pave the way for a brighter future where human potential is unleashed, societies thrive, and global progress is truly sustainable.","My Education and career goals have always revolved around making a meaningful impact on global health and addressing healthcare disparities. I am deeply interested in pursuing a career in biomedical research and innovation to develop novel technologies that can improve healthcare access, diagnosis, and treatment in underserved communities around the world.

Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on biology, chemistry, and engineering courses to build a strong foundation for contributing to the field of global health technologies. My research interests lie at the intersection of medical diagnostics, point-of-care devices, and sustainable healthcare solutions. I believe that innovative technologies have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery in resource-limited settings, where access to traditional medical facilities is often limited.

The Center for Global Health Technologies aligns perfectly with my aspirations and research interests.

","n middle school, I was part of a science club that participated in a regional science fair competition. Our project involved designing a sustainable urban garden that utilized recycled materials and innovative irrigation techniques. It was an ambitious undertaking for a group of middle schoolers, and we faced numerous challenges along the way that required teamwork and perseverance to overcome.

One significant hurdle we encountered was the limited budget for our project. Our initial plans included purchasing various gardening supplies and materials, but it became clear that we needed to find creative ways to cut costs. This is where our teamwork came into play. Instead of feeling discouraged, we collectively brainstormed alternative solutions.

We divided tasks among ourselves: some of us researched DIY methods for creating planters from recycled containers, while others focused on designing an efficient irrigation system that used minimal water. Each team member brought unique ideas and skills to the table, and through collaboration, we devised a plan that was not only cost-effective but also aligned with our project's sustainability goals.

Perseverance was crucial during the implementation phase. As we constructed our garden, we faced setbacks like leaky irrigation systems, plant diseases, and unexpected weather conditions. These challenges could have derailed our project, but we were determined to see it through. We held regular meetings to discuss the issues, brainstorm solutions, and allocate responsibilities for troubleshooting.

For instance, when our irrigation system leaked and threatened the health of our plants, we didn't give up. Instead, we worked together to identify the source of the problem and applied trial-and-error solutions until we achieved a reliable and efficient irrigation setup. The process demanded patience and persistence, and each setback taught us valuable lessons in problem-solving.

In the end, our hard work paid off. Our sustainable urban garden not only won recognition at the science fair but also became a source of pride for our school. The project showcased how a group of determined middle school students could use teamwork and perseverance to overcome challenges and create something meaningful.

This experience taught me that even as young individuals, we could make a difference by collaborating effectively and persevering through difficulties. It highlighted the power of diverse perspectives and the importance of maintaining a positive attitude in the face of setbacks. The lessons I learned during this project continue to influence my approach to problem-solving and teamwork to this day.

","During my Python class midterm project, I encountered a significant challenge that tested our team's ability to work together and persevere. We were assigned to groups, and our task was to create a project focused on sustainability in electricity using the Python programming language. As we began our project, it became apparent that turning our ideas into functioning code was more difficult than we had anticipated.

Initially, our group was enthusiastic and filled with ideas. However, as we started coding, we quickly realized that the project was more complex than we had initially thought. Our individual skills varied, and the vastness of the project seemed overwhelming. Our group was struggling to find equal footing as our deadline was approaching. 

Despite these setbacks, we recognized the importance of teamwork, and regrouped with a better understanding of our common goal. By discussing our ideas openly, breaking the project down into smaller components, and letting each group member complete a part of the code they specialized in, we had found our way around our problem. Throughout the process, communication with one another was vital, along with perseverance and determination. As the deadline approached, we combined our code into a functioning program which surpassed our initial expectations. Our Python program on sustainability in electricity successfully highlighted the importance of eco-friendly practices and was a testament to our collective efforts.

This experience taught me important lessons about the power of teamwork and perseverance. By effectively communicating and breaking down complex challenges into smaller, achievable tasks, we were able to tackle a challenge which initially seemed impossible.

It pains me to know that millions of people in different parts of the world struggle to even get access to one glass of clean water. Even in the United States in rural areas like Flint Michigan, accessing clean water is one of the biggest challenges of survival. Meanwhile, in the more suburban areas like Cary and Charlotte, we have plenty of water to drink, to shower, to clean our dishes and clothes, and even enough to do some recreation. It's not fair that we can take water for granted while millions of people around the world are dying of thirst. It‚Äôs hard to believe that over 70% of Earth‚Äôs water is harbored in the oceans and it cannot easily be consumed in this form. I believe that there can be a way to end this crisis of thirst on our planet by making use of our oceans. If these vast bodies of water can be utilized, not only will thirst be minimal, but also water-borne illnesses will be prevented, sanitation standards will be raised, and an increase in agriculture and food production. Of course, there are the small first steps that everyone can take like taking short showers and not letting the tap run for too long. However, when you look at the bigger picture, the most practical way of solving this problem is to find an effective way to make use of ocean water especially for our growing population and increasing need for resources.

It was hard to come up with a design solution for the problem of my choosing. ,"The UN sustainable Development Goal of clean water is still very important to me. This topic hits close to home because the country that my parents grew up in, India, is a country that has water scarcity.

Oftentimes, my visits with my grandparents and extended family in India ended not only with immense joy but a feeling of sadness. While I was grateful for any chance to see them, I was often saddened knowing that they lived in an area with limited resources, making it extremely hard to access medical help. Additionally, their financial ability also made it even harder to find affordable and accessible options much like the hundreds of people that lived in their village and across the country. Over the summer, I was given the opportunity to participate in a biomedical engineering program where I was able to compile my learning to work on a project with a partner to research, design, and utilize CAD to model a portable device aimed to detect known human carcinogens from second-hand smoke within the human body. We modeled the device with impoverished countries in mind, where the issue of secondhand smoke inhalation tends to be highly prevalent but rarely addressed. We made sure to design our product to be a reusable and portable machine, to allow better access within impoverished areas lacking proper medical care and hospitals. While working on this project, I often replayed memories of my aunts cooking in India over an open fire when their stove wasn‚Äôt working properly. The smoke and smell from this was something I can still recall to this day and the research I had conducted prior to the designing of my device only furthered my desire to find a solution for this problem. Our research showed that second-hand smoke contained over 7,000 chemicals, 250 of which are known human carcinogens that could cause cancer within the human body. Seeing firsthand what it was like for people in these areas, and how unbeknownst to them the damage that was being inflicted upon their bodies as a result of their simple everyday practices. The creation of this device helped to further my passion for biomedical engineering and finding medical solutions for those that are unable to access them. Furthermore, my experience working as a director within a nonprofit aimed at donating food and money for hundreds of food-insecure families also continued to open my eyes to the hardships that those in unprivileged areas experience. I truly believe that the UN Sustainable Development Goal for good health and nutrition is one of the most important for those privileged enough to access resources as well as those that are unable to as it can be a differentiator between life and death. I sincerely hope that medical innovations will expand to ensure that no one will ever make their health a second choice and that I will be able to partake in making such a thing possible.","For me, I've found that there is no greater satisfaction than diving into the depths of a problem and getting my hands dirty to find the solution. Through my experiences within middle and high school, I've found that this passion could be combined with my love for engineering and biology to tackle the issues plaguing not only my community but those in need globally. Over the summer, I was selected to participate in a biomedical engineering program where I was able to see various presentations from professors and Ph.D. students from Stanford University, Georgia Tech, Texas A&M, and even Dr. Megan Madonna from Duke University. Later, utilizing my learnings from these presentations, I was able to work on a project with a partner to research, design, and CAD model a portable device aimed to detect known human carcinogens from second-hand smoke within the human body. We modeled the device with impoverished countries in mind, where the issue of secondhand smoke inhalation tends to be highly prevalent but rarely addressed. This not only opened my eyes to the opportunities within biomedical engineering to create change but also allowed me to apply knowledge to solve an issue for those in need. In the long-term, I hope to utilize my passions to pursue biomedical engineering and focus on the intersections of engineering to address issues within the medical field for those that are underprivileged, sepcifically within the field of cancer. In college, and even through the rest of my high school career, I hope to continue gaining experience within the biomedical engineering field and healthcare broadly through hands-on research experience to utilize in my career later. I hope to pursue an M.D./Ph.D to gain more insight within the health field to focus on biodesign as a physician or researcher in the future. As a director of Bread for America, a student-led nonprofit aimed at erradicating hunger, I've been given the chance to create change and help those in need by raising $30K+ and donating over 10,000 pounds of food to food-insecure families. This helped me realize my passion for making change, through science and activism alike, and continues to be a vital part of who I am, another reason why I aim to continue my research to specifically address and be accessible to the issues of those in need. Through the Center for Global Health Technologies and as an Ignite Maker, I believe that I can utilize the opportunity to continue my learning within the engineering field with the combined support of my peers and mentors to design prototypes to address a health issue within my community, and even potentially continue working on my model of the device to detect scond hand smoke inhalation. I plan to utilize what I learn to continue fostering my love for biomedical engineering while using it towards furthering my knowledge to continue my work as a student, future engineer, and lifelong learner.","It would be simple‚Ä¶right? ‚ÄúDesign bioengineering-based solutions to a real-world medical problem‚Äù ‚Äì little did I know, that these were the 8 words that would plague my thoughts for the following weeks. After being assigned to complete a project by utilizing my knowledge on biomedical engineering and the bioedesign process, my initial reaction of excitement soon turned into curiosity, later becoming worry. In the coming few weeks, I would find out that this project would not only influence my interests but even my career goals. Our first step, was to identify our problem, or what we would be working to solve. After intensely researching, my partner and I were able to find a big issue; many people, often times from impoverished and underprivileged areas, had no idea that they were even inhaling second-hand smoke. Our research showed that second-hand smoke contained over 7,000 chemicals, 250 of which are known human carcinogens that could cause cancer within the human body. We found that this second-hand smoke was often considered worse than inhaling primary smoke from cigarettes. After coming up with our needs statement, we quickly hit a wall. In fact, we had no idea on where to go next. After even more research, planning, and designing, we began to make some more progress but were still unsuccessful in coming up with with our device. After coming together to pool our work and knowledge, we were finally able to come together to begin and create our preliminary designs for the components of our device. Although it took hours of research, hard work, frustration, and often mini-debates within our team, we were able to successfully design, and later utilize CAD (Computer-aided design) to model our final device. Despite the hard work, time, and strenuinity that this project required, I had realized that I had enjoyed every bit of it. The excitement of learning more about cancer and second-hand smoke, as well as the issues faced by those living in impoverished areas, such as my grandparents,  only continued to fuel my passion for this topic but for biomedical engineering as a whole. As a result of this project, my patience and determination was tested but I was able to take away the knowledge I gained in addition to realizing the importance of team work, hard work, and continued perseverance despite any obstacles that may be faced. I know that these will be some of the many skills that I will continue to utilize on a day-to-day basis as I further my future within biomedical engineering.",Y,Anwitha Kumbham,Non-binary / third gender,pre,,Evaluating because it allows communities to share feedback and needs that the prototype has  to take into account in the future,All of the above are viable solutions to the new need,Listen to the community,Evaluate,"Focus on community goals because goals, like problems, require attention and effort","Feasibility- will it be an affordable option for people?,Desirability- does the design solve a problem?,Viable- is it a short or long-term solution for the problem?",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,50,80,90,70,,50,60,80,70,"While I am confident in my abilities to put in the work and time required to create a product utilizing the engineering design process by utilizing my prior knowledge of the engineering design and biodesign processes, I feel I may require some guidance in relation to the actual constructing of a product and the use of various materials.",100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,"My motivations throughout the engineering design process is knowing that I could create something that would potentially impact and benefit the lives of people in need.

Beyond that, having the organization with the program made it much easier and helped keep me on track so there was structured way to approach the engineering design process. Overall, I‚Äôve learnt so much from this entire program and have only furthered my interest in biomedical engineering.","The most difficult part of the program was coordinating between my partner and I (both being from different cities), as well as building virtually. While the support and help of the trainers/team made the process much easier, I did find it hard learning about circuitry and figuring out the process. I think coming into the program with an idea and some preliminary research made it much easier so we could have a more clear idea on potential final results. This also provided its own challenges as we didn‚Äôt need as much time to research potential issues, etc. but we were able to spend that time looking further into existing solutions and designing possibilities for our final creation.","The UN Sustainable Goal 3 is still one of the most important goals to me because it is one that resonates the deepest with me. My original interest in it was sparked due to the conditions and lack of resources my grandparents, living in rural India had, but through the Ignite program, I have been able to explore the depth of the issue which has further solidified my belief that it is a goal I want to work towards achieving through engineering. I hope to further my focus on accessibility and sustainability so that people living in communities lacking resources, oftentimes who need them most or are extremely affected by issues, can access the help they need.","I think the Ignite Maker program helped to further solidify my passion for biomedical engineering and opened my eyes to the possibilities within the field. As of right now, I am between studying biomedical or mechanical engineering but the program has helped me direct my focus to want to work on creating innovations focused on accessibility and aiding those living in low-access areas.","If I could change any part of the Ignite program, I would hope to allot more time towards the building/execution phase of the program. I think being virtual led to a greater learning curve, especially when dealing with circuitry, which required further time and research on how to figure things out. Overall, I felt that the year and program was extremely successful ‚Äî with my participation being one of the highlights of the school year ‚Äî and I truly believe I learnt a lot and have become a better student and future engineer because of it.",
196,Arya Kumar,Arya,Kumar,She/her/hers,17,Senior/12th,Asian,Durham Academy,Durham,27514,GWHT website,Global health,4,,Good Health,"‚ÄúAt the beginning of the pandemic, I began reading extensively, and after reading Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity by Katherine Boo and learning about the daily struggles in Annawadi, one of the 2,400 slums in Mumbai, I began to realize that a fundamental part of sustainable development is access to clean water, proper sanitation, and effective health care. However, this does not only mean building infrastructure with good sanitation, clean water, and health care; it is critical to target the existing health problems within these areas before sustainable development occurs. Infrastructure conducive to a healthy population is only adequate if it mainly works to prevent diseases rather than treat existing diseases; hence, it must target a healthy population. Focusing on populations‚Äô health is a substantial prerequisite to sustainable development.‚Äù
The above is what I wrote in my Ignite Maker application last January before I began to research diseases in these slums. Although I initially intended to focus on communicable diseases in slums, I quickly realized that there are already so many efforts to counter communicable diseases. I realized that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) lack adequate attention, so I decided to focus on researching diabetes and its prevalence in Mumbai slums. This led me to design a prototype that would assist people in taking their medicines because a significant problem in these areas with diabetes was a lack of adherence to medicines. 
From when I began reading about health in Mumbai slums to my time researching diabetes, my understanding of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of health has broadened, showing me the larger picture of maladies that plague the impoverished in Indian slums. However, I am still far from completely understanding what this sustainable development goal encompasses. However, I expanded my understanding a little bit this past summer. I spent six weeks in Delhi, India, where I got a glimpse into the poverty that some people in this city face. On the surface, it‚Äôs hard to determine whether a person is suffering from a disease. However, one thing that struck me was the malnourished look of the people I saw on the streets. I had an hour bus ride every morning to school, during which I would see people lying on the streets and waking up. It was extremely disheartening, and having this first-hand experience of seeing the struggles that these people go through has shown me the next steps I want to take in researching and coming up with solutions.","I have always loved learning about the world, and because of this, I have always imagined my future being in a different country. Combined with my interest in global health, I know that I want to work abroad in impoverished communities to fix healthcare in these communities. In addition, I really enjoy studying culture and languages. I have studied Spanish in school since 5th grade, and I have recently been learning Hindi and Tamil. Through my language studies, I have learned more about languages and culture. I love discovering different aspects of the culture of places around the world, specifically in Latin American countries and India. My current Spanish teacher is Peruvian, and I have immensely enjoyed learning about Peruvian culture from her. In addition, my family is from India, and I have grown up learning about the culture in Tamil Nadu (where my parents are from). However, there is only so much one can learn about culture; immersion is necessary to experience culture truly. This is another reason why I want to live abroad: I want to immerse myself in cultures that are different from the culture I have grown up in. Through working abroad, I hope to combine my passion for global health with my language and cultural studies. I have been exploring ways to study both global health and culture to begin this process. 
Specifically, I would like to pursue a double major in college in Global Health and Cultural Anthropology. I think that this combination of majors would be perfect in that it would allow me to pursue my passion for working in global health with my desire to learn more about people, culture, and languages. In addition, during college, I would like to spend at least one semester studying abroad, gaining experience in healthcare in another country. Specifically, I want to help make healthcare more accessible to people living in impoverished and rural areas. I also want to teach people how to create the tools to stay healthy for themselves. Both of these experiences will only come with studying abroad, so studying abroad in college is something I want to do. Ideally, I would like to spend time in India because ever since learning about the health issues that plague the slums of India‚Äôs most populous cities (such as Mumbai and Bangalore), I have had a strong interest in working to improve healthcare in these slums as well as improving health education in these slums. I would also like to participate in different global health projects in my undergraduate years, such as Ignite. In addition, after college, I have been thinking about participating in Peace Corps. Spending two years in a different country and working to improve healthcare in a community is a perfect opportunity for me to grow in global health and immerse myself in a different culture. In terms of my career, I know that I want to live abroad working in global health; however, I am not sure of what career paths offer this. My thoughts are to focus on educating myself and gaining experience in this field so that I am as well equipped as possible when the time comes to search for career options. 
Because I want to learn as much as possible about global health and expose myself to this field, I am interested in working with GWHT as an Ignite Maker. I want to help design solutions for health issues in different locations, and this seems to me like the perfect place to gain exposure, experience, and knowledge about this. ","Going to the movies with friends in a foreign country where neither you nor your friends can speak the language proficiently is not necessarily the greatest idea. I had been in Delhi for two weeks when my friends and I went to see a movie in a theater as a part of a school activity. Naturally, we wanted to buy snacks. In Delhi, one purchases food in a movie theater differently than in the United States; instead of simply buying food from the concession stands outside the theater, there is someone in the theater who will take your order. We were told that there were three flavors of ice cream: chocolate, vanilla, and almond. My friends and I ordered three chocolate ice creams for the cost of 450 ‚Çπ ($5.67). However, when the waitress returned, she held three almond ice creams. Before we even knew that she had given us the wrong flavor, she had disappeared. Holding the almond ice creams in our hands and knowing that we had already paid for them, we were unsure what to do. At that point, all we wanted was a refund. We all walked outside to the concessions stand and requested a refund in English. No one there spoke English. However, we wanted that refund. All three of us began trying to speak in broken Hindi to ask them for a refund. Over and over, they said that it was against their policy, and please, do try the almond ice cream! Eventually, I began to talk with more confidence and was able to begin guilt-tripping the cashiers in Hindi. I told them that they lied to us and told us there was chocolate ice cream for sale when they only had vanilla and almond ice creams. Because of this, I told them we needed a refund. They then told us it was against policy, after which I angrily asked them where this was written. At this point, my perseverance had caused a decently large commotion, and the manager came over. I calmly explained to him the situation, and he, probably fed up with my antics, gave us the refund.

I really want to be able to help move closer to attaining this goal, and I think that through Ignite, I began to understand more what methods of helping are actually beneficial.","They have slightly changed, but the fact that I want to go into global health has not. At first, I wanted to go down more of a humanities track, trying to integrate culture and health; however, now I feel as though I might want to take a more science-oriented direction.","I know it is meant to be unstructured, but sometimes I just have no clue what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing.

I think it is necessary to acknowledge that we are going through tough times in terms of communicable diseases. I think it is very important to raise awareness on preventative methods. Another thing is that I have been passionate about health for a while now and it is a potential career goal of mine to work in a health department. I want to help people and make sure that everyone is the best that they can be. This is also important to me because I want to be able to come up with something that‚Äôll help a group of people feel welcomed and included.

I want to do this because I realized how much it would help other people to be one of the people managing the place.

I love helping people improve their lives and I am always excited to find solutions to problems within the community. I previously was in the high-school program and I did work with prosthetics which was so interesting because I was learning in the process and I felt really good after. I had the chance to cooperate with my other high-school peers, as well as staff and professors during interviews. ","I am interested in working with the Center for Global Health Technologies because I would like to move forward within the Biomedical Engineering field. I love the concept of combining my two favorite subjects of engineering and global health. In the future, I would love to create medical devices that save lives or make lives longer through my engineering or even a possible business I may create. I love working with others my age on global projects and I think Ignite is the perfect place for me to expand my expertise and experience. ","I recently completed an Independent Study with one of my friends who joined me close to the beginning of my process. We created a device that helped people with AK prosthetics bike regularly. There were many challenges within our process, such as coming up with a design that fit everyones needs and that matched our goal, finding people to interview and get feedback from, and lastly 3D printing our device 4 times because the first 3 were not good enough. We pushed through together and I redesigned many times to solve our problems. Although it was tough, I appreciate this experience.

When I was little I lived with my grandma in California. It was 2009 and I didn‚Äôt understand why we had to use fake grass in the backyard. We had it because California was facing a water shortage and still is affected by global warming even in 2009. It‚Äôs important to me because without clean energy we will see more people abandoning their homes because of the rise of sea levels. In AP human geography our last project was we looked at every UN Sustainable Development Goal. In the project we came up with proposals that countries should take to help them reach the SDGs. The SDGs that I enjoyed exploring the most was #10 because globally we are facing huge income disparities. Out of the ones offered here clean energy speaks the most to me because it's relevant through the Inflation Reduction Act. The U.S is back agreeing with the rest of the world that we will have to stop producing carbon emissions and reducing our footprint through incentives. In Duke REP we had a module that used electrical engineering that is the most similar to clean energy because you're basically making technology that will help power the world in a sustainable way.,My college goals are to get into college as an engineering major. I would love to go to college because I would be the first in my family to attend a 4-year university. I believe I have worked hard in some of the hardest classes my school offers and challenged myself through taking them. I really haven't thought much about a career goal. I just imagined I would find some type of job in engineering because the triangle area has many STEM opportunities. I know college is not as helpful as it used to be 50 years ago but you will make connections there to find employment once you graduate. Apple and Google are moving into the area. I would hope to find a job at one of those companies. Over this summer I explored biomedical engineering research at the tosh lab. It let me experience a lot of research because biomed engineering is a combination of many types of fields. It was an amazing experience and I got to run my own assay with the help of my mentor. I want to explore more research opportunities related to global issues like climate change. Clean energy is vital to stop climate change. One of my instructors at Duke REP talked about this opportunity and it sounded exciting. That's why I'm interested in working at Global Health Technologies as an Ignite Maker.,"It was the beginning of the new year. Within my robotics team we call it build season. During build season the engineers work on building the robot but my team has 2 divisions the other one is engagement. We do outreach events and contact sponsors. During build season we write an essay we submit to FIRST and it's called chairman‚Äôs award. It is just as equally as important as building the robot. We put what the team has done over the past 3 years since last time we submitted. The issue was I would write my paragraphs as an analytical paper instead of showcasing stories and the meaning behind them. My leader never told me anything was wrong with it but as the due date came closer stress started to arise. Most of it not even being done yet, I decided not to go to the meetings because I lost my ride to get there. I stopped going to meetings for almost 2 weeks. I was on the verge of being dismissed from the team. When I went back my division leader and the coach of the team pulled me aside and talked about my future on the team. They asked what I thought was the fair decision because I meet the criteria to be dismissed. I told them they should dismiss me from the team. The coach told me because I was there it showed I still had interest in being a part of the team. I told him yes I still wanted to be part of the team but it was unfair to my group that I made them write the parts I was supposed to do. We came to an agreement that I shouldn't miss any more hours. I would have to ask someone for a ride to the team space that went to my school. I was the problem but I went back to see my fate on the team. I restarted my attempt to write the paper. I hit writer's block and so did my group. We all relaxed for a moment. Next we thought about how we could get out of the block and my friend mentioned we could see previous submissions. We finally got a flow and finished just as it was about to be due.

205,Khadija Diop,Khadija,Diop,She/her/hers,17,Senior/12th,Black or African American,The School for Creative Studies,Durham,27712,Email,Health Administration and Biomedical Engineering,4,,Good Health,"  My interest in health is personal. My father is senegalese, and to truly grasp my full identity, I've lived some of my years in Senegal and Gambia. As a result, my experiences there have shed light on and shaped my views about global health. I‚Äôve realized that there is a great imbalance in access to healthcare in the global community, and within countries as well. Having lived in both the U.S. and Senegal, I've witnessed them. I'm able to receive medicare in the United States. I've had many visits to clinics, hospitals, and dental facilities throughout my life and I've never once had to stop and carefully consider whether my family could afford it. The same applies to my siblings and my parents. When I visit Gambia, however, I notice that things aren't the same for my family members there. Every trip to the limited hospitals in the area requires a fee, and no one in my family has insurance to cover it. The services that I witnessed there also greatly contrasted with what I was used to. A small room, crowded together with the hospital beds of dozens of other patients is where one of my cousins gave birth. When I had visited her, I noticed that utilities and supplies seemed to be the bare minimum. Her baby didn‚Äôt survive. And it‚Äôs not just her. I have many other cousins who had miscarriages. It‚Äôs very common to have infant deaths during delivery in my family. Those who could afford it often traveled overseas to be treated for their conditions in more developed facilities. This is a problem that exists everywhere. Even in the United States, where I‚Äôm able to receive the proper healthcare that I need, there are people who don‚Äôt qualify. My family and community in the Gambia don‚Äôt receive the services that I‚Äôve experienced, and it hurts when I think about it, because I feel like I‚Äôm being favored, somehow. I‚Äôve also realized that the access to and quality of health facilities aren‚Äôt the only factors that affect the health of my community. My interest in health spurted from wanting to change the inequality that my family goes through, and from there, I wish to make a meaningful impact, not only on my family, but on any others who experience it. 
","  I have a vision of my ambitions and a general idea of a plan for my future career, but those plans aren‚Äôt set in stone. I intend to pursue a degree in Health Administration or Public Health, and Biomedical Engineering. I then hope to continue my education through medical school and become a medical doctor. This arrangement, however, is subject to slight modification. Being interested in health, engineering, and medicine, I‚Äôm still in the process of carving my career path to give me the best of all three fields. I‚Äôm also considering whether I wish to pursue medical research in graduate school before aiming for medicine. My main drive to follow such a path is to broaden my knowledge on how to fund adequate healthcare for individuals, expand medical technology, and promote healthy communities. My greatest ambition is to open various healthcare facilities and find the means to fund healthcare to support my local community in the Gambia and expand from there. As a high school student, school consumes most of my time and there aren‚Äôt many opportunities in my classroom for me to explore and receive hands-on experience in what I want to do. I feel that working with IGNITE will allow me exactly that. I believe that it will give me the incentive to critically think about how I can directly apply my strengths to solve problems and achieve my future goals. 
","  The first time I was told to ‚Äúengineer‚Äù a solution to a problem, I was stuck, like my feet were submerged in hardening cement. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I solved a problem, but the memory burns bright because it was my first assignment as an engineer. It was a PLTW course and I was assigned a team to figure out how to save a group of people (colored chips) from drowning when a natural disaster occurred. It had seemed impossible. We had one hour, and I remember there being about 5 paper clips, a 3 inch strand of tape, a pair of scissors, a balloon, a rubber band, an empty paper towel roll, and about 4 index cards, I think (why the list is so specific, I don‚Äôt know, I probably added extra things). With this random arrangement of items, we were told to construct a system that would transport the colored chips over a certain distance without touching it. My entire group was shocked, and it seemed that we would all fail the assignment. The time limit started, and we rushed to the supplies. We gathered and discussed our ideas, no matter how impossible they seemed, because from the way our teacher was grinning behind his desk, it was obvious that it could be done. We all kind of clicked, because none of us wanted a bad grade. The ideas were crazy, but with the small inventory, we discovered that there were a variety of different solutions we could create. We had no idea whether our ideas were even plausible, but time was running out, so we had no choice but to continue forward. A good amount of the ideas failed. Multiple times, in fact. But I don‚Äôt remember any of us getting upset. Just jumpy, rattled and full of unrest, blurting out any alternative we could think of. We would only have two attempts to deliver all the chips, so I suggested we fold the index cards into packages, sealed with paper clips to hold all the chips in one place. Another member of our team thought to place the packages in the paper towel roll, blow up the balloon and slip it in the hole so that when it deflated, it would push the roll and the chips over the line. None of us really stopped to figure out if that was how physics worked, but it sounded like a great idea, which it was, even though it didn‚Äôt work. Before her idea, we had never considered using the roll. But then another idea sparked in one of our other team members. She thought we could use the roll to make a slingshot with the rubber band. Sure enough, when she slipped the band over the roll and pulled it back, holding the package of chips, it shot forward. It was so simple that we had to take a moment to think about how long it took for us to try it. It was some time ago and the all the details are a bit blurry, but that memory was a very exciting moment for me because it was the first time I had experienced what being an engineer was like and the power of team input in such a situation.

206,Lishore Kumar,Lishore,Kumar,he/him/his,16,Junior/11th,Asian,Tomball Memorial High School,Tomball,77377,YiBE,Biomedical Engineering,4,,Good Health,"	As a Speech and Debate student, I‚Äôve learned the importance of not just domestic issues, but international ones. Through wars and political turmoil, one of the only shared factors between countries is the want for scientific development and global wellbeing. Perfectly conveying this, is the Global Health and Wellbeing initiative of the UN, not just highlighting the wanting nature of our global health, but also recognizing that there are wide disparities in key demographics of people. Being one of the first goals to focus on equity rather than solely equality, the Global Health Initiative allows us to keenly focus on countries and communities that continue to be harmed. 
        Living in 3 different countries, 2 of which are developing, I‚Äôve seen the shared prevalence of sicknesses and diseases cascade through them; not only harming people, but wiping out decades of scientific progress. As such, the Global Health and Wellbeing goal is critical to addressing diseases like Covid-19 and Malaria, as well as targetting long-standing issues like pollution and educating others on sexual reproduction. Through events like the Covid-19 pandemic, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs simply not possible to address health issues on a domestic level, but rather on a culminated international scale. Working with an initiative that represents a coming-together of communities will allow me to not only make scientific progress, but social progress as well.","	Through my engineering classes in high school as well as my international political background, I‚Äôve fostered an interest in the combination of the two. As such, I‚Äôd like to major in Biomedical Engineering and minor in Political science. I believe that by coupling biomedical engineering with Political science, I can understand health markets on a governmental and political scale; an overlooked reality of the health industry. Finally, I‚Äôd like to master in Biomechanics due to my want of making medical device innovations. 
	For Duke IGNITE, I have three potential research prospects in the Global Health and Wellbeing initiative. First, I can research vaccine disparities in specific demographics and create a program to help bridge that gap. A second research interest that I have is looking at obesity rates in rural areas of the world and creating a potential solution to the problem. Finally, a third research prospect I have is to study transportation-based accidents around the world and engineer a deterrent to the problem. Each one of these goals closely aligns with a module of the UN Global Health vision of 2030. 
	I am interested in being an Ignite Maker and working with the Center for Global Health Technologies because it places innovation in the context of helping globally affected people. Often times technological advancements target commercial markets and don‚Äôt truly address large and longstanding issues. But by being an Ignite student, I can create a foundation in engineering that specifically targets underserved demographics. 
","        Papers flew across the room, names were yelled, and fear was buzzing in the air. My robotics team had finally made our dreams come true: making it to the World Championships. In 2 short weeks, we would be performing on the international stage, something we had only dreamed of. Yet after months of preliminary processes, hoping for this very opportunity, we now found ourselves struggling to repair our machine. With parts breaking, code malfunctioning, and morale at an all-time low, our team was slowly falling apart.
	After a week of struggling, the comments began. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we fix this?‚Äù, said a coder. Followed by a scattered set of nods. Next, an engineer, saying, ‚ÄúIf I could reduce the torque, we‚Äôd solve the battery problem.‚Äù Echoed by a roomful of agreeing nods. Slowly seeing more and more people chime in, I myself joined the conversation, commenting on the problems that I faced. As heads started to perk up and conversations opened, the air was once again buzzing; not with fear, but with potential. 
	Discussing the problems we were facing and expressing our thoughts on parts of our machine, we slowly delved into our work. At first, laying the problem out in front of us, we were able to slowly break it down and understand the interconnection of our jobs. Working for hours on end, we broke into groups and began solving an aspect of the problem. After a weekend of working together, our team huddled together with held breaths as we tested our robot. Seeing our machine carefully perform each action, we were able to observe our contributions before our eyes. As our robot made the final move of its routine, we quite literally jumped with joy, sobered at seeing our struggles finally translate into success. And just 5 days later, we once again jumped with joy; this time, from making it to the World Finals. 
	As students, we‚Äôre prone to fear. Through the days in robotics that we struggled, it was the shift from dealing with it personally, to communicating as a team that allowed us to succeed and take the international stage. Laying the problem directly before us, we were able to understand how we could each contribute to a solution, generating a stronger and more cohesive team. Not in spite of our struggles, but because of them.

Knowing assemblies were always quite boring and the teaching staff would just go on and on about stuff I did not really care about, for a change, I felt that day was going to catalyse an inner change within me. And it really did. 

I remember how striking it was for me to see that Poland‚Äôs efforts were not strong enough - how many of these 17 goals from the list shown on the humongous screen my tiny eyes could barely grasp, were clearly being overlooked. How many of these goals I thought Poland was doing enough for, such as green areas for ecosystem preservation. This moment released many emotions in me, because it felt like a part of me was awakened by knowledge I was not aware of before. Hence, I think the moment that I saw this list covered in a colour, which brings out connotation of death, I knew I had to create and do the change and focus on specific goals I thought, and still think today, I can contribute towards.

I strongly believe that was the moment UN Sustainable Development Goals became important to me; when the importance of them was slammed in-front of the face of a smaller me. ","Due to my interests in biomedical engineering, I am specifically interested in the field of bioimaging and biodesign. My route and path towards getting to my passions for biomedical engineering, and how it can revolutionise the medical industry, started with my interest in genetic modification, specifically CRISPR technologies and how they can combat mental and psychiatric disorders. I have done research on how CRISPR can help with depression, and now I am working on a research paper connected to CRISPR and ADHD. Both mental health disorders relevant in my family, thus issues that I care about, vastly due to their importance in my every day family life. 

Furthermore, that is why I am interested in working with the Center for Global Health Technologie as an Ignite Maker; I want to broaden my medical and Health related interests. I want to suplement the change needed for my country, as well as others, to working towards the success of the UN SDGs. I hope I can work on a project that will be able to connect my interests for finding out medical solutions for problems people may think are not so medical after all. 

I have done the Youth in Biomedical Engineering Summer Programme run by Youth Inventa this summer, completed the ‚ÄúI am a Young Sustainability Champion Programme‚Äù and received a badge of achievement and completion, as well as have gotten and participated in the quarter finals of the Climate Science Olympiad; I strongly believe that these recent achievement will allow me to make the most out of becoming an Ignite Maker. All of these programmes and awards have allowed me to enhance skills such as ambition, resilience, determination and teamwork to get the most out of your biomedical engineering related programme for this academic school year.

To be honest with you, we did not really know what we were going to do; what we knew was that, my friend and I, loved to write and popularise science. Hence, on a late afternoon, actually very late (2 hours towards midnight), Nicola and I catalysed the creation of Innovation Hub - a youth-led Science magazine platform, where young inventors, makers and scientists can contribute and get their written work out there, whilst supporting the UN‚Äôs effort of Goal 4 - Quality Education. 

After a 3 hour long call, with eye bags nearly reaching the end of both our faces, we have managed to create the website for Innovation Hub. Despite many mistakes and difficulties we encountered, such as getting the url name for the website and designing its colour choice, we recovered from them quite quickly - that is what I refer to as perseverance. 
    This teamwork and perseverance shown, carried as along with my friend Nicola, towards collaborating with over 15 members from more than 10 countries, releasing our first biannual issue, publishing award-winning research and most importantly, creating what we saw as lacking in other science communication platforms we have sought to participate in; Innovation Hub is more than a collective, engaging and connecting platform publishing science work - it is a social project grown from pure science passions working towards creating change and becoming doers. Innovation Hub is the unique opportunity for youth like us, who want to get their work out there, but do not know where to start. Frankly here, it is quite simple, just shoot us an email at innovation hub.world@gmail.com!

Specifically, due to the fact that my country lacks opportunities like that for high schoolers to conduct research and gain scientific extracurricular options outside the classroom, I believe that Ignite has really changed that and I would love to participate next year. ","The most difficult part for me was motivating myself to actually write my research review paper. It has taken a lot of time for me to do it and not procrastinate. Without doubt, I would participate in the programme again. ","The UN sustainable development goal of my choice would be goal number 4 relating to quality education; I am very fortunate to be in a school in Poland, where an English curriculum is offered, and I hope that in the future more youngsters and poles around the world will be able to participate in programs such as Ignite and attend schools such as mine. ",I would still love to do something related to biomedical research and biomedical engineering.

208,Noreen  Majeed,Noreen ,Majeed,She/her/hers,14,Freshman/9th,Asian,Raleigh Charter High School,Cary,27519,previous Ignite participant,Pre-medicine,4,,Good Health,"I have had my fair share of doctor‚Äôs offices,  been sick numerous times, had consecutive doctor visits, was poked and prodded, administered shots and medicines,  overall an unpleasant experience. Now, as I have gotten older, I realize why all of those tears were worth it, they were small increments of keeping me safe and healthy for the long run.  It‚Äôs not just about staying fit, or eating healthy- there is so much more to it, good health means balancing your physical, social, and mental well-being. Studies have shown a direct correlation to a positive outlook toward life, meaningful social interactions, and pushing through setbacks with a more optimistic view. I personally have realized that staying healthy transpired to being energized and happier with my day-to-day life. This experience in my own life, of transforming my own health encouraged a new dream of mine- to inspire the same healthy change in others. While I have been fortunate to receive the best possible care, it sadly is not the state of the world. 

As the statistics from UN Sustainable Development Goals states, ‚ÄúCOVID 19 has caused devastating effects on the world, threatening decades of progress in global health including 500 million infected, disrupted health services in 92% of countries, halted progress on universal health care, decreased global life expectancy, and more devastating consequences.‚Äù These numbers show how we truly have a serious problem on our hands. The world's health, right as we have the ability to change it for the better, is declining into a global crisis due to our indifference towards the effects of the recent pandemic that are slowly coming upon us. If this rate continues, it puts global health in a devastating place with children not receiving vital vaccines, increased disease rates, no health coverage or equipment needed to treat patients, and prevalence of anxiety/depression. 

My passion is to change the global health state for people of all ages anywhere, specifically related to the UN target- to strengthen the capacity of all countries against disease outbreaks and maintain good national health especially in developing countries. An experience I have had related to this is witnessing a developing country with poor community health. Due to my family heritage, I have visited India multiple times in my life and it truly inspires you to push for change. In many underprivileged areas, chronic illness is visible on the streets mainly without having access to healthcare and thousands die due to this. My aunt who completed medical school in India tells her first-hand experience of how patients would have survived and gone on to live a healthy life if government funded medical facilities had even half of the facilities available in the United States. Along with this, equipment, medication, surgical facilities, and affordability are lacking, making life for those living in India taxing  from catching a cold to having a life changing disease such as cancer. Hearing and witnessing these first hand experiences have empowered me to push for global change in healthcare.
","I have contemplated hard and found purpose in making an impact through medicine. The medical field has always interested me as the discoveries that have come from the field have drastically changed the world as we know it. Among the various medical specialties, I have always been drawn to the research of infectious diseases. I believe by delving into this field and making progress towards the eradication of disease I can make the biggest difference towards improving global health, by creating these treatment methods but also making them available to developing countries, providing equitable access to healthcare, effectively reaching my aspirations while still pursuing a career I am deeply interested in. 

After high school, I would like to pursue pre-medicine, and  I am confident that  this path allows me to have a personal value to changing lives in my day to day life. The core of medicine is service and serving others before yourself, a value I connect to. I believe there is a real difference between just treating patients and being motivated to alleviate their pain and suffering while ensuring they lead a healthier life in the future. Keeping this in mind,  I would like to change healthcare to focus more on patients and helping them lead better lives rather than funding the corporate world. 

I am hoping that my career choice will provide me with the opportunity to build upon my purpose by assisting others to stay healthy both physically and mentally, a vital element into being able to achieve individual goals and their own purpose in life. To me, this encompasses everything from the little things like putting a smile on their face to the big things such as helping them overcome a life-limiting illness. Beyond this, I would like to make a worldwide impact by improving community health through research to help limit the impact of future pandemics, pro-active vaccine development including for those who are immunocompromised, and so much more that can help us come together as a stronger, healthier community. Many of the milestones along the way (such as IGNITE) can help me achieve this dream.

I believe that the IGNITE program can provide me with a major stepping stone on my career path. The STEM-based environment will allow me to grow and learn with like-minded people that can help maximize my potential in a collaborative environment. The mentors there will allow me to be pushed to achieve my best while still receiving proper tutelage from those well-versed in the medical field. I believe IGNITE  will allow me to get a proper experience in the medical field, interacting with medical professionals, researching medical developments, putting research into reality to create a project and many other experiences that can help me confirm my presence and truly make a difference in the medical field. Also, I have connected with the DGLHI‚Äôs especially to their program which encourages the youth of our generation to pursue their passion projects. A project I found interesting was the research to detect viral threats earlier, in particular those who started with animals and have the capability to become a pandemic. Creating these connections between the animals and infectious diseases fascinates me as we come to a new discovery in the field, predicting diseases and preparing for them. Relating to this personally, I am motivated to delve into research towards diseases with IGNITE to create life-changing discoveries that adhere to DGLHI‚Äôs vision- global equitable health care.
","In 2020 during the midst of the COVID pandemic,  I joined Schoolhouse.world(SHW) a free peer-to-peer tutoring platform founded by Sal Khan (from Khan Academy)  as a tutor in the hopes of helping children both locally and on a global scale gain access to free, quality education at a time when the pandemic challenged traditional educational modalities. After tutoring a few sessions, I was ecstatic from the multitude of positive feedback and more importantly, it felt good to help others get what I believe is a basic right to education but I still felt incomplete. I wanted to make a more meaningful impact, and I felt I could do it best by helping at Schoolhouse‚Äôs core- the volunteering side of the platform, I applied and contributed to teams such as onboarding, auditing, and user support. For a few months, all was going well as I hosted sessions and completed my volunteering roles in tandem. 

Then, abruptly, both user-support co-leads left leaving the team in pieces. User support is key to keeping the platform functioning on a daily basis. Team members started to drop their duties, the team was no longer connected, and had no leadership. Despite this, I tried to keep some resemblance of normality by completing assigned tasks, took on the assignments left behind by members not fulfilling their roles and hosting team bonding to make us more connected.

 Then, the biggest surprise occurred when the product team lead of SHW thrust me into a role that I was wholly unprepared for - User Support Team Lead. In the beginning, I was only equipped with the knowledge as a team member and had to learn the team‚Äôs internal workings while juggling the role's challenges. It was (and still is) a challenging role and at times I contemplated giving up but I steeled myself by remembering the platform's impact and my connected passion to expand SHW‚Äôs reach so more could gain access to free tutoring . I also realized that I needed to earn the team's trust and that was not going to be easy considering my lack of experience and the sense of abandonment from the prior team leads.

I launched a full project to bring the team together involving tracking to ensure everyone‚Äôs duties had been completed, weekly team syncs, and virtual team bondings, and utilized more experienced members and my product team supervisor to bring the team back on course. Despite this plan, we continued to have problems(like every team) but when problems arose we brainstormed as a team to find creative solutions that could overcome challenges. To quote a specific situation, one day we had an influx of chats coming in about missed sessions (due to tutor no-shows) and people started to get frustrated- missing out on vital tutoring help. The User Support team rallied together and used everyone‚Äôs varied teaching strengths to host sessions for every person who had missed out on help due to a tutor no-show. From this situation, we were able to come together as a team of merely a few dozen people through grit and perseverance and portray a united front for SHW.  These experiences helped us come closer together  as a team, and the role is a reminder of the lesson to push past boundaries and maximize your team‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses, and individual empowerment to create meaningful impacts.

This uncertainty towards actually engineering a design was difficult for me to overcome in the IGNITE Make program.,"Health is the most important to me because not only does it affect the physical body it also affects emotional and mental health. The prevention of chronic diseases helps me give back to my community by providing them with a better lifestyle. Beyond this, they are proven to become happier and enjoy life with good health motivating me to make that impact on as many as I can. ",It has not changed by college and career goals of pursuing medicine in light of helping others rather strengthened that goal. I am now even more passionate about medicine especially since I now have a few more skills thanks to the program that I can put towards that topic. ,I would love more in-person meetings ex: at Duke campus rather than always meeting on Zoom or only having in person meetings for building. I feel like it would help build a better sense of community!,
209,Prisha Rathi,Prisha,Rathi,She/her/hers,17,Senior/12th,Asian,Enloe Magnet High School,Apex,27523,Email,Biomedical Engineering,4,,Good Health,"Achieving good health for the world requires the confluence of many different fields. Sure, supporting good health can mean the development of biomedical innovations to better health in a clinical setting, but it can also lead to innovations that can be used in countries with limited healthcare resources. There, local language translators and focus groups need to be involved to make sure the device is intuitive, engineers need to be involved to make sure the device works in areas riddled with power cuts, sustainable support needs to be created to upkeep devices, and so much more. 
The interdisciplinary connections required in the health field is what draws me to it. I have always had very varied interests, ranging from fine arts to computer engineering, and there is never quite one discipline that allows me to incorporate the diversity of perspective I harbor, as well as allowing me to collaborate with peers from different areas. However, the field of health encompasses the gamut of my interests, allowing me to design, build, and innovate without bounds, with new, interesting research and complexities rolling in by the hour.
Of course, as someone interested in good health, I am also drawn to the fact that  improving health outcomes means helping people achieve their maximum potential. The devices I hope to create should improve people‚Äôs lives so that they can be healthy and become productive members of society. Additionally, creating these innovations in good health doesn‚Äôt only help the target audience of the product, but rather contributes to the ocean of knowledge in biomedical technologies. Becoming a stepping stone for future innovators that come up with devices that can further better the world is another overarching goal of mine, and I hope to achieve it by working in this field.","Currently, I am dual enrolled in Wake Tech to get my Associates in Engineering. I hope to then transfer to a four year college for a bachelors in Biomedical Engineering, eventually going to graduate school and potentially beyond. I eventually hope to design biomedical devices to create advances in my particular interests: low cost imaging technology, soft robotics, and neural/retinal prosthetics.
While attending a Duke BME course during the summer of 2021, I first learnt about CGHT and the low-cost technologies they were creating to be implemented in rural areas. This really struck a chord within me as I also volunteer for CORD (Chinmaya Organization for Rural Development), which creates sustainable programs in the Indian subcontinent that deal with everything from health education to empowering women through employment. BME has always held a place in my heart due to its fusion of so many of my interests (engineering, medicine, and design) but putting BME devices to  help humanity is what truly makes me want to work in this field for the rest of my life. Being able to work with the CGHT to achieve this meaningful combination would allow me to create a solid foundation on which I can base my future college innovations. I can also contribute to CGHT innovations with my robotics and art background. As part of my robotics design team, one of our main focuses is constantly iterating our design to be faster and more precise, as CGHT does with cost and precision. In art, I often investigate the power of simplicity within my pieces. Being able to transfer that critical eye over to CGHT would be key in creating simpler, cost-effective designs.
Additionally, for my International Baccalaureate Extended Essay, I am researching the implementation of BME devices in low/middle income countries, focusing specifically on the cultural and linguistic barriers in the use of technology. Being able to work with the CGHT to design a device with these barriers in mind would give me a lot of insight in coming up with new ideas to overcome them. ","As a member of student council, I was assigned as the lead of decorations for prom planning. One of the problems I encountered was coordinating the supplies and team I needed in a much shorter time frame than expected. 
The first part of the problem was acquiring the supplies for prom on such short notice. To fix this, a lot of persistent emailing and countless lunches and mornings were dedicated to letting my teacher supervisors know what supplies I needed and how I could get them at the earliest.
The next part was assembling the team I needed to both plan and create all the decorations for prom. Although our initial team was a group of 6 students to oversee planning, disinterest and conflicting schedules had whittled my workforce down to two  people as soon as crunch time started. To overcome this, I rallied more people from my council to join decorations and involved several volunteer, art, and calligraphy clubs in making decorations. With the incentive of volunteer hours and many instructive slideshows, I trained many students in making decorations, more than remedying the problem. Specifically, I made sure to ask for and take ideas from the art club to decorate prom so that we could get a more universally appealing and inclusive design. Making sure other people‚Äôs perspectives were included was one of my main tools to make sure prom looked magical in everyone‚Äôs eyes, not just mine.
The final part of the problem was assigning people to the jobs that they would do on the day of prom. Between cancellations from key members and a very distracted group of helpers, one of the main examples of my perseverance came from consistently keeping my small group on track, so that we could finish the setup on time. By making sure plans were clearly outlined and decorations were neatly organized, installation of all the pieces went smoothly and ended up finishing earlier than planned. 
Ultimately, taking on this problem gave me a lot of valuable lessons and my perseverance helped achieve the goal of executing our school‚Äôs biggest prom in one of the shortest time frames.",Y,Prisha Rathi,Female,pre,,Evaluating because it allows communities to share feedback and needs that the prototype has  to take into account in the future,All of the above are viable solutions to the new need,Listen to the community,Define,"Focus on community goals because goals, like problems, require attention and effort","Feasibility- will it be an affordable option for people?,Desirability- does the design solve a problem?,Viable- is it a short or long-term solution for the problem?",Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,No Opinion,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,70,80,80,80,70,70,70,80,70,"Since I have had some experience in the design process before (robotics, hackathons, PLTW classes), I feel fairly comfortable as a baseline in most aspects of the design process.

Health is incredibly vast, spanning not just human care, but social justice, economic problems, environmental problems, and so much more. It is so entwined with our life because the field literally concerns our life, and I still find myself very motivated to make more technologies for the health sector.","A little-- previously, I was set on going into industry after biomedical engineering, but I found through the program that I shone in researching and designing solutions rather than being the hands-on creator. Now, I plan on doing a more research heavy academia route, potentially trying to become a professor and have a lab eventually.",I would add more curriculum and potentially some guest speakers! Getting to know more broad and concrete problems within the community as well as learning more granularly about all the usability factors to consider when making a device would be incredibly useful.,I am planning on going to Johns Hopkins for biomedical engineering!

The idea that plants, light, or excrement could be used as fuel was something that I was fascinated by. In the second grade I knew nothing of what global warming was or how petrol is used in cars. These ideas were distant and I was not conscious of my environmental decisions. Seminars throughout elementary and middle school told students to shut off water and stop using unnecessary light around the house. That was all I had to do to play my part in stopping the impending ecological downfall of the planet. As I grew up and saw my home country, I knew that there was much more to the problem than that. In Haiti, my conveniences turned into luxuries. Indoor plumbing, electricity and air conditioning were things that I had never second-guessed having in America.
I want to make a place for my family residing in Haiti where these conveniences are no longer luxuries. I want them to have access to clean, cheap energy that can power their houses and appliances. Their struggle inspires me to learn more and help them overcome the many systems placed against them.","Computer Science has been my main goal of study since my first year of middle school. Now that I am about to graduate, I need to know what concentration that I am going to work in. By trying a little of each branch of computer science, I have learned that I want to use this form of study to help others. I want to work on research that helps to prevent or locate disease in patients. By working with the Center for Global Health Technologies I could help realize those dreams by doing research.
Currently I want to research in artificial intelligence. I believe that AI could be used in medical devices to observe sequences or patterns of illness within individuals and create a diagnosis based on this. I want to help create tools that can do this and more as an Ignite Maker.","Currently I work as a Mu Alpha Theta officer and I am in charge of helping our club get the people that it needs to thrive. Our school prides itself on being a school focused on technology and sciences, so those that do not excel in those areas tend to be discouraged to join clubs that focus on either of those areas. Many are afraid of being wrong.
As an officer, my team and I created plans that tried to include all levels of math. We created problems and games so that students would learn to enjoy math again. It is hard after being in an enviroment that shames you for being wrong, to join somewhere else that encourages you to try anyways. Knowing that, we continued on to create a fun program for those at our school to enjoy.
